stale.  Ok, it's a &lt;em&gt;LOT&lt;/em&gt; stale.  One of the problems I've had is the time it took to
make changes to the site was more than I had available and offline editing was a
pain.  Instead of going with an all-singing, all-dancing website with all sorts of
features that no-one except myself really cared about, I've made it very simple.
We have articles, news, blogs, some photos....and that's about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the online world we all live in is largely centred around "cloud" services,
such as Facebook, Flickr and the like, I've simply made this site fill a gap in my
own use case and scratch an itch.  That's all.  Hopefully this will allow me to
update more regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to see the old site, it's been put out to pasture over &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://gray.net.au/old_site"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, here's a panorama from a recent trip to Honiara :)&lt;/p&gt;
