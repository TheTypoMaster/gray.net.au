Woot. The Falcon is back in my garage! The bike is no longer in my
possession, and there is a new car in the garage too! I'm impressed.
The local Ford dealer warned me that my new gearbox might take up to 2
weeks to be fitted (as stated earlier). In reality the car was
dropped off on Monday, they called Wednesday to say the new gearbox
had arrived, and I picked the car up yesterday! So two weeks turned
into 4 days - impressive. Less impressive was the side mirror switch
missing from the door when I picked the car up, but they fitted a new
one and I was on my way.

The new car (Nat's Lancer) is now parked in the garage after a
marathon effort to rearrange it. It's a tight fit with a Lancer and a
Falcon in the same garage, but it's better than having one live on the
driveway out in the weather!

I'm going to have to move the drinks fridge somewhere (maybe into the
house, or under the patio) so I can use it. But that's only a minor
thing. At the moment, there's about 30cm (1 foot) clearance between
the side of the Falcon and the fridge door - not enough space to open
the fridge. So that will have to change before summer really kicks in!
Can't have the beer getting warm can we?!
