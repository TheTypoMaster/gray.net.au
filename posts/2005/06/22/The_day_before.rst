Tomorrow is my birthday and for some reason this hasn't inspired me to
break forth into uncontrollable displays of happiness. In fact it's
barely raised a smile. I didn't want to turn 30 last year (or ever for
that matter) and I sure as hell don't want to turn 31 this year!
I guess that's called getting older and for the first 20-odd years of
your life it's a real buzz to get a year older as each year brings new
privileges and opportunities that only come with age. However, once
you get past that, nothing happens each year other than a few more
wrinkles and a little more wisdom (wisdom - read "scars" heheh).
Birthdays become the metronome of life, keeping beat and marking the
time.

All is not doom and gloom though, with Emily getting older I am really
enjoying watching her grow and develop! She's growing up *way* too
fast for both Nat and I. Just when we've got accustomed to her being a
certain age/stage, she goes and changes. Life is great.

Another great birthday present this year has been my return to the
air. Although I'm still coming up to speed for parachute operations,
the general concepts are falling into place nicely and each flight
becomes easier than the last. The hardest part is getting all radio
work done, plus manage the tracking to the drop zone and making all
the run-in calls to the jumpers (5 minutes, 3 miles, 2 miles, 1 mile,
open door, jump out...). It's a busy 5 minutes then you just point the
plane at the ground and make like a brick :)

Well, I'll be back tomorrow with more news and info about my birthday
pressie :)
