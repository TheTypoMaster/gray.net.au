It's the day after my birthday and it wasn't so bad after all. Natalie
bought me a neat little radio scanner (so I can listen in on air
traffic etc), and Emily got me a photo frame with three little photos
of her and Natalie. It's really sweet. Mum and Dad sent me some money
which I'm going to put towards a new GPS.

So what's it like to be 31? Dunno - not much different to 21 really
except I've got less hair! Having the flu is not making me feel any
younger though...but that's pretty subjective. I guess I'll just have
to take these birthdays on the chin and grow old disgracefully. Heck
why clean up my act now?!
