Got a last-minute call up this morning to take a load of parachutes up
and kick 'em out. How could I refuse. It was on my lunch break anyway
:P

So I get the call up and long story short: they need a pilot coz
Emma (the other pilot) has to go to Bankstown (YSBK) to pick up one of
the other planes. No biggie. Emma even fuelled and prepped the plane,
put in the flight plan and organised a pilot's rig (parachute). Way to
go - all I need to do was dip the tanks, kick the tyres and fly.
Sweet!

So I decided to take the camera along with me and get a couple of
happy-snaps. You can see the `photos of today's flight here`_. I'm not
entirely happy with the flight though. There's a couple of important
radio calls I need to do BEFORE the punters jump out (*in order*);

#. Clearance from Sydney Departure to drop and descend
#. Broadcast on Sydney Radar (area) frequency notifying of drop
#. Broadcast on Wollongong CTAF notifying of drop
#. Call the drop zone and give them a 3-5 minute "heads-up" that the
   drop is about to happen

I forgot number 4! Dammit!! I call them up after I got into my descent
which was FAR too late. I'm sure the guys got down just fine, but the
ground crew (also jump masters) like to watch the canopies open in
case there's problems.

I'll stick my hand up for this and admitted on the radio "my bad". But
I was thinking on the drive home from the airport, why did I miss such
an important call? Why wasn't I thinking straight? I think I've come
up with the answer.

This was the only the third jump operation I've done in about 3
months, and the first one I've done in almost 4 weeks. The stick-and-
rudder flying I can do in my sleep (you get like that after a few
thousand hours) but **procedurally** I was so far behind the 8-ball it
wasn't funny. I missed a call and didn't pick it up until it was too
late. I'm not claiming this lack of recency as an excuse, but as an
oversight. A link in the chain that led to me ultimately forgetting
the radio call.

When I flew solo freight runs for a living, you get good at being
strict on yourself to maintain standards. You're constantly reminding
yourself that 5KIAS over speed on the approach is NOT acceptable, that
"almost within tolerances" for the practise ILS (in VMC) is NOT
acceptable, that missing a item on a check list is NOT acceptable. You
have to be hard on yourself or you get sloppy. I knew that, and I
practised it.

Since I've got back into flying, specifically as a jump pilot, I think
I've become sloppy. I'm not being hard on myself, I'm not approaching
the flying with the right attitude. I seem to adopting the attitude
that this jump flying is pretty simple, I've done HEAPS more
complicated things in the past and have stopped paying attention. I'm
not unsafe (yet) but if I allowed this to continue, the next "oops"
could be fatal.

Today was a wake-up call! No more "she'll be right", no more "I don't
need to be attentive". I'm getting back into a professional mind-set
where near-enough is NEVER good enough. It's on the numbers, by the
book, per the checklist or not at all!
