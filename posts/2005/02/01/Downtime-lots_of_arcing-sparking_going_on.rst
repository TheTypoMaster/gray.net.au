Yup - I got hit in those thunderstorms that clobbered southern NSW on
Tuesday night. We lost the power for about 30 minutes but the Internet
connection was down for a bit longer (in fact, I'm writing this
without it - so no idea when it will be back up). Just figured some
people might want to know why we went offline... so now you know.

**Update: Wednesday February 02, 2005 @1:40PM:**
Internet connection came back up around 10:30am today, but the web
server's cooling fan died and the system did a thermal shutdown
(oops). That's fixed now (after 2 trips to the local electronics
store...8cm fan nope, take 2, needed a 9cm fan! DOH!). Hopefully this
is the end of the downtime for a while! I got a good zap from the
earth wire on a device I was unplugging during the thunderstorms but
I'm alive. So far everything has come back up with only minor damage
to the database server (which was fixed with a restore of the dead
tables from this morning's backup). The firewall machine had some big
problems with one of it's partitions... really gotta convert it to
reiserfs or even ext3 (currently ext2..it's an old box OK?!). The web
server was rather well behaved and didn't need any intervention when
it came back up :). I've **REALLY** got to invest in a UPS!

The house and everything that was outside (like the boat) is just wet
mainly, but they reckon these storms will persist for a while into the
night - *sigh*.
