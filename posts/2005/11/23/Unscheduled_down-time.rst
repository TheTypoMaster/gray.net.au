Dagnabbit! Just when you sit back and get a contented smile growing on
your face at how well your network is going.... ** BANG!!! ** The
stinking web server throws a hard drive. Stupid bloody computers!
Thank goodness for backups though. After the last lot of down-time
I made sure my backup regime was a little more robust and thankfully
it's come up trumps and no data was lost :) Yay for me.

The "ye-olde" hard drive in arachnid (the server that drives
Gray Online) which was a venerable 6GB Western Digital had survived
almost 7 years of service, the last 2 being on basically 24x7! Well
it's now dead. Totally.

Thankfully a friend of mine had a brand new 40GB Western Digital
sitting in his office still in its sealed static bag. Coz he owed me a
little cash for a recent favour, we cancelled the debt and I got a new
hard drive for next to nothing - thanks Rocci!!

Long story short, the new hard drive was installed, the old data
restored, the boot loader configured and voila! We're back online!!
The new drive has a bigger cache (2MB - the old one had 512kB) so the
performance might be fractionally better now too.
