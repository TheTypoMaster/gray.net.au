Whilst on the train this morning I started thinking about all the EMR
sources in and around my house. It got me thinking... In themselves,
none of the EMR (Electro-Magnetic Radiation, aka "Radio Waves")
sources are particularly powerful but all contribute to the whole.
Let's see, I've got:

#. The wifi access point with +5dB gain antenna sitting on top of my
   work-station's montior - ie, about 2 feet from my head :P
#. My laptop sits about 2m (6 feet) behind me. Also talking wifi
#. My wife's computer down the hall also has wifi with another +5dB
   gain antenna
#. I have a wireless broadband connection with a 30cm (1 foot) dish
   which is about a +25dB signal gain on the house.
#. UHF/VHF radio and television antennas
#. A satellite dish
#. Three mobile phones in the house - 2 usually attached to me
#. The cordless phone system with two handsets and the base station
#. **PLUS** enough high frequency electronic noise from the 5 PC's,
   one laptop, a 3kVA UPS, and digital home theatre equipment to fry
   anyone's brain!

I figure this can't be good, but there's been no definitive evidence
to prove otherwise. I guess if there are any cancer researchers (or
foil-hat-wearing paranoid weirdo's) who want to view me as a case
study, I'm more than happy to be observed...in my clothes I mean.
