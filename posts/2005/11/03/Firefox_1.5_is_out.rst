The fine folk over at `Mozilla`_ have released a new version of their
web browser Firefox. If you want the latest-greatest web browser
available then `surf on over to the release page`_.

**UPDATE 1-Dec-2005:** Firefox 1.5 has gone "stable". Go get it while
it's hot! Same link as above :) Highlights of the new release:
+ New web technology support: CSS2 and CSS3, SVG, JavaScript 1.6
+ Faster back/forward page jumping
+ Many (many) bug fixes


Remember this is a Release Candidate (ever wondered what the "RC"
meant? Well now you know). So there may be some bugs, but think of it
this way; Microsoft release beta software all the time, never tell you
and it's buggy. At least Mozilla are putting their hand up and saying
"*we want people to test this before we call it production ready*" -
and they're NOT charging you for the final version once they get it
right! Way to go Mozilla!!
