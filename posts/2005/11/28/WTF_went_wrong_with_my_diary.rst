This time last year we'd been skiing for almost two months (every weekend) and
life was good. Time was plentiful; even with a 4 month old hanging around.
This year, it's 3 weekends from Christmas, and we've been skiing ONCE!  WTF
went wrong?!

Seems our diaries are filling up every weekend with "stuff".  What stuff?  Oh,
I don't know - but looking back on it, there's been visitors drop in, people
needing transport to/from the airport in Sydney, cars blowing up, boats being
recalcitrant, and illness.

The worst bit is that every weekend that is fine, warm and sunny with light
winds are the weekends we've been sick/busy/away! The weekends we ARE at home
and wanting (desperately) to go skiing, like this last weekend, it pours rain,
blows a gale and the temperature barely nudges more than 18Â°C!  It's almost as
if there are forces at work that do not want me skiing.

Sure, my left arm is still weak and numb most of the time, and skiing usually
causes me to put my common-sense on hold (the two combined might be a bad
mix), but still - **I WANT TO GO SKIING!!**
