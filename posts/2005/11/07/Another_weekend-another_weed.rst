Spent a good proportion of this weekend pulling weeds and other plants
out a friend's place. That, and staying up late celebrating the end of
another year at the venerable `University of Wollongong`_. My best
friend Chris, and his wife Nic, have bought a new home - yay for them!
BUT, it has about a decade of free-range plant growth all over the
house. No that's not a typo - the plants surrond the house and are now
(in true triffod-style) attempting to cover the house too. Many
trailers were hauled to the dump, several large bushes met the chain
saw, large rocks were ousted from their slumber, many spiders squashed
and a good time had by all.

Chris and Nic put on drinks and BBQ at the end of the weekend's
proceedings and many laughs shared throughout too. Even though my body
is telling me it was all hard labour, my brain seems to think it was
actually fun!

Saturday night Nat and I (and Emily) went to a uni-friend's (Rocci and
Daniella) place for a post-2005 project/thesis recovery dinner. Some
other ex-studnets (now graduated...bastards!) were there to celebrate
with us too. It was good time with great company and great food.

Emily was a little hard to settle but porta-cots and strange
environments, coupled with a fractured routine, never mix really well
with her though. We usually pay dearly for it the next day, but Emily
wasn't too bad on Sunday, so I guess that's a good thing.

Nat and Daniella got on really well and both being pregnant seemed to
have plenty to chat about. That left the blokes to run amok with
flamable liquid, fireworks and leaf-blowers. Don't ask!
Roll on next weekend - I need a break!!
