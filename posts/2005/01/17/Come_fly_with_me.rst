Well, four and a half years after flying my last professional flight,
I'm now BACK in the air!! Three flights in the last week or so with
`Southern Cross Gliding Club <http://www.gliding.com.au/>`_. Yesterday
I even managed a 1hr 46min flight on nothing more than rising air.
Shouldn't be long now and I'll be solo again :) Stay tuned, I'll be
adding a new photo album and maybe some video in the not-too-distant
future.
