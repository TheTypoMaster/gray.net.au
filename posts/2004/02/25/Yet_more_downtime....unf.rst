My fault this time. I acquired an older-style SCSI drive but it
doesn't want to play with my web server :( Consequently I spent most
of today (Wednesday) trying to coax it to life. Alas the bloody thing
will be a 36Gb paper-weight...until someone donates a Ultra-Wide SCSI
controller ;) ( HINT HINT! )
