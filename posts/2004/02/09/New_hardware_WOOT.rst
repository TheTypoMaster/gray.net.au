YAY! I have finally managed to build out some "new" equipment. The new
webserver (not this site - the one that runs all the "other" sites) is
now a P200MMX, upgraded from a P133. The database server is now
sharing the same machine as the mail server which is a Celeron433,
upgraded from the P133 again. Now all the P133 has to worry about is
firewalling duties and some other sundry network stuff (like DHCP,
NTP, NNTP, DNS etc). It's all technical "back-end" crap but you
*might* notice pages generate faster due to the faster database
server...maybe not too :-/
