Nat and I trundled off to the obstetrician on Tuesday (10-Feb) and
went though the usual round of questions. The doc seems happy enough
with Nat's condition and the progress of the baby. The details
follow....(click "Read More") The initial appointment went well. The
doc even has recent issues of "Inside Sport" in the waiting room. Way
to go doc! Nat had to fill in a bunch of forms, have her blood
pressure taken and other stuff along those non-invasive lines.

Once we got in to see the doctor (he was running 30 minutes late...but
what doctor **isn't** these days?) we discovered a rare individual
indeed. Despite his already nuked schedule, he didn't rush us and went
to great lengths to make sure all our questions were answered. He also
dumped another bunch of forms on us: pre-natal class info, hospital
bookings, etc.

Then he asked if we'd like to **SEE** our baby - we said "no thanks,
I don't want a peek at the biggest miracle since Jesus was raised from
the dead" - **NOT!!**

I can honestly say I was awe-struck seeing our little one's heart
beating and being able to see their arms and legs, and head etc. It
all of a sudden became "real". I know that sounds strange, but for
Nat, her body is changing and she can feel the baby move every now and
then. For me though nothing much has happened - except my sleep is
just as interrupted as Nat's :) Having seen our baby for the first
time, it hit home, in a good way.

We've got another appointment with a specialist obstetrics imaging
place in a few weeks which will give us a very good picture (and video
too!). In answer to the inevitable question: NO, Natalie and I do NOT
want to know the gender of our baby until it's born. So if you think
you can figure it out from any of the ultra sound pics I put up - KEEP
IT TO YOURSELF!! ;-)
