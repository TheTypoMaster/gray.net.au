Well after a rather stressful 24 hours, the new ISP is installed, my
network re-engineered (properly this time) and the routing glitches
fixed, IT'S WORKING AGAIN!! The domain delegation is still a bit
screwy; I've lost my login details to redlegate it...and it's a long
weekend! So some people may have trouble reaching this site for a few
more days yet.

**UPDATE: 1:16pm Sun 13th June 2004**
Found my login details and redelegated the domains! Now we just have
to wait for a day or 2 for the changes to propogate through the
Internet. But other than that, it's all done!
