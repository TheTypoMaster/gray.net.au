This is a heads-up for everyone who uses my mail server. Over the long
weekend my entire network is going to be offline for a while. I am
transferring to a `new ISP <http://www.fishinternet.com.au>`_. Read on
for the details. Fish Internet are installing a WiFi-based internet
connection on Friday (11th June) and this will require me to take my
entire network completely offline for a few hours (hopefully). However,
the down-time may extend for most of the long-weekend. The other problem
is I'll need to re-delegate my domains which means even though my network
may be back up, you may not be able to find it. Delegations can take 2-3
days to filter through the entire Internet. If anyone **REALLY** needs
to access anything and can't just call my home phone or mobile (those
who know these numbers keep them to yourself!).
**MORE BANDWIDTH!**

The best thing about the new connection is that it has MUCH more
bandwidth than my existing 128kbps ISDN line. In fact the product is
called `EtherWave <http://www.fishinternet.com.au/broadband_intro.php>`_
which is basically WiFi (Wireless Ethernet or 802.11). Sweeeeet :)
Anyway, when it's all up and running again, you'll notice the website
and mail server etc, are all a lot faster. Of course if you're on dial-up,
you probably wont notice any difference because dial-up is still much
slower than my current 128kbps ISDN line....those on broadband will notice
a change :)
