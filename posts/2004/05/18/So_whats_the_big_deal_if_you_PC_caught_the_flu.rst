Seems a number of my friends' and relatives' computers are dangerously
unpatched and unprotected. The general comment has been along the
lines of "what's the big deal if I get a virus?". Well here's the
explanation why **I** think it's a big deal and how you can protect
yourself and the Internet too :)

What's a virus anyway?
----------------------

A virus is a piece of software that does "bad" things to your
computer. Just how bad depends on the virus. In the old days, viruses
usually attempted to trash your computer by erasing the hard drive or
destroying your software. Whilst some modern virii do that most don't.
In fact most modern viruses try to stay as invisible as possible so
the poor unsuspecting user is completely unaware they have been
infected.
Viruses have many variants. The most common of these are worms,
trojans and mass-mailers. The methods of infection for each of these
is different. The method of infection usually determines what category
of virus. Spyware (malware) is another type of malicous program that's
sole aim is to leak your personal information.

What do viruses do?
-------------------

Modern viruses have a more sinister objective; information leakage or
turning your computer into a "zombie". In this "connected" era, the
new currency is information. Information about your
browsing/buying/e-mail habits right through to your bank account
details and passwords. Information is king.
The other aim of virus writers is to hijack your computer so other
people can use **your PC** to send spam, launch attacks on other
systems, or infect other computers. When your computer is infected
with a virus that allows this, your system is said to be "owned" or a
"zombie". In other words, not totally under your control.

I get all that - why is it a problem?!
--------------------------------------

It may not be a particular problem to you. Sure your PC might get
"owned", turned into a rouge "zombie" and be polluted with spyware,
why should you care? Here's a few reasons:

#. Owned/Zombied computers are used to relay spam and viruses to
   everyone else! Your machine could be inadvertantly adding to the mass
   of spam already flooding the internet. Your PC could also be relaying
   viruses to other unsuspecting users.
#. Spyware/Malware can be used to hijack (take over) your internet
   connection. If someone gets hold of your username and password they
   can then run around pretending to be you. Imagine the grief that could
   cause you! Not only that, many internet accounts have download/online-
   time limits and excess charges are applied if the limits are exceeded.
   Ever wonder how much your basic "pay-as-you-go" account can cost when
   someone else is using your account 24 hours a day?
#. Along the same lines as the previous problem, any personal
   information about you can be used to "steal" your identity. People
   have had bank accounts and credit cards opened in their name and stuck
   with the bills when it was actually someone else using their identity!
   All this plus the potential to "leak" other personal information like
   phone numbers, street address, etc.Many people enjoy the convenience
   of internet banking which is a good thing. Would you let a stranger
   stand next to you at an ATM and copy your PIN? Of course not! So why
   should you let anyone get access to your computer and do the same
   thing with your internet banking details.
#. All this cruft on your PC does two main things (apart from the
   stuff above): slows it down and makes it unstable. A friend of mine
   recently complaind his PC would take 30 seconds just to show a letter
   after typing it. Turns out he had 2 spyware programs hammering his CPU
   in the background and chewing up his dial-up connection! Not that it
   matters right? All this virus stuff only affects everyone else?! Sure!
   (*rolls eyes*)

How do I protect myself?!?
--------------------------

This is the most irritating part - **it's easy!**. However, most
windows systems (your PC) are so vulnerable you need to install some
3rd party tools to protect yourself. Here's a list of my favorites and
what they are designed to protect you from.

+ `Windows Update <http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com>`_ Software is never
  perfect and the bigger and more complicated it is the harder it is to
  secure. Consequently software needs to be updated from time to time
  (weekly is a good schedule). Microsoft provides this service free of
  charge to all registered users (and some stuff is even available to pirated
  copies of Windows). Keep your system patched to minimise trojan and worm
  attacks.
+ **Virus scanners:**
    #. `McAfee/NAI <http://www.mcafee.com/>`_
    #. `Symantec (aka "Norton") <http://www.symantec.com/>`_
    #. `Free AV/Antivir Personal <http://www.free-av.com/>`_

  A virus scanner is **mandatory** if you are going to use the internet.
  Many come with extra features like personal firewalls (see below) and
  other stuff to further protect your system. Virus scanners will only
  be useful if you keep them updated. New viruses are discovered **every
  week** and weekly updates should be done to ensure you are covered.
  However, virus scanners will only tell you after you've downloaded a
  virus (not necessarily infected with it) so in the case of worms,
  which attack faults in software without any intervention on your part,
  you really need more protection.
+ **Personal Firewall**
    #. See Mcafee and Norton above, they both have products you can
       **purchase**
    #. `Zone Alarm (FREE!) <http://www.zonelabs.com/store/content/company/products/znalm/freeDownload.jsp>`_

  A personal firewall is like a "cyber-bouncer" and controls what sort
  of traffic goes on and off your computer. They are the doormen, the
  gate keepers, the security guards. They can't tell if a particular
  file is a virus but they **can** say whether or not a type of data is
  allowed or not. Personal firewalls dramatically reduce the potential
  that your PC will "owned" or "zombied" and makes it very difficult to
  be infected by a worm. **ZoneAlarm** is about a 4.8Mb download but
  well worth the time it might take to get over dial-up. It's simple to
  install a reasonably intuitive to use. If you're not using it already
  (or some other personal firewall) DOWNLOAD IT NOW!!
+ **SpyWare Scanner** These are like a virus scanner but specifically
  designed to hunt down and remove spyware (which isn't technically a
  virus). If you value your privacy and security I'd suggest you
  download `AdAware <http://www.lavasoftusa.com/>`_. This is a **FREE** download and does a good job
  of hunting down nasties that leak your personal information. Once
  again, this AdAware software needs updating but less frequently than
  the virus scanners or windows. An update about once a fortnight should
  keep you safe.

But dude, all this stuff costs money!
-------------------------------------

Yep, but there are some `FREE alternatives <http://www.thefreecountry.com/security/antivirus.shtml>`_ that might be useful.
AntiVir Personal Edition and ZoneAlarm will cover you for most
virus/worm threats and the combined cost of both is zero, zilch,
nadda!

So no excuses folks - get out there, spend some time getting those
patches installed, virus scanners updated and firewalls running!
