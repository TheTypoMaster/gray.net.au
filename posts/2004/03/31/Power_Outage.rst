This morning (*Wednesday 31st March, 2004*) I lost all power to all my
machines. This meant **The Gray Matter** and a few other sites were
down for about 2 hours while I sorted out the mess that was caused by
simultaneously pulling the plug on every machine in my network!
Apologies to anyone who was bitterly disappointed not being able to
access this site.
If anyone has a spare UPS they want to donate - I'd be forever
grateful! NULL
