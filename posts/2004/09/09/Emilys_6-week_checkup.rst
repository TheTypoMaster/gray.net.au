Emily has been to the paediatrician for her 6 week checkup and
everything is fine :) She has put on weight, grown a bit longer and
put on a 10/10 cute display. You go girl!! Dr Brereton gave Emily a
good going over and he was happy with her progress. She now weighs
4.44kg (9lb 11oz) and is 54cm (21.3in)long. This means she has put on
about 1.4kg and grown about 5cm since birth. This is smack in the
middle of "normal" which is encouraging.

She didn't complain much and managed a couple big cute smiles for both
the doctor and the receptionists :) She's such a cutie. As we were
walking out the receptionists were talking to each other about how
cute Emily was - made me a very proud dad! This parenting thing isn't
so bad afterall.
