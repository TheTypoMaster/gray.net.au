OK, so my "inner geek" is coming out, but this is just too cool:
`A standard truck that runs on hydrogen AND generates it's own fuel
via solar panels!! <http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/1001hydrocar01.html>`_
Here's a quote from the article: "Built for less than $10,000, the
project has caught the attention of experts in alternative-fuel
research.

"Over the past three years of research in hydrogen, I've been more
impressed with what they did than anything else I've seen around the
world," said Scottsdale inventor Bryan Beaulieu"

Yes I'm a nerd, but this is such a great step away from our dependence
on oil. Oil is running out (or can't be produced at a rate to meet
demand) and this will only get worse as time drags on. A little more
focussed research and lateral thinking and we could could have
cleaner, more efficient hydrogen-fuel-based vehicles :)
