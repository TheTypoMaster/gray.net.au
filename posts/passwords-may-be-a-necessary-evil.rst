I have banged on for `quite a while now
<http://gray.net.au/old_site/article.php/20110325100849965>`_ that reusing
passwords is a bad idea, using dictionary words for passwords is a bad idea,
using personally identifiable information as a password is a bad idea...you
get the picture.  I hear the refrain from users regularly "*but remembering
passwords, especially good ones, is hard!*" and I agree with you!  **Here's my
secret though**; I don't remember my passwords *at all*.  My Facebook
password? No idea.  Twitter account? Pfft, wouldn't have a clue.  Flickr
account? Couldn't tell you. They are all randomly generated strings of
letters, numbers, and symbols exceeding 20 characters.  Who the heck can
remember that?!  Better still, how the heck do you crack or guess it either?!
And that is the entire point :)  Using a password strength checker like "`How
Secure Is My Password <https://howsecureismypassword.net>`_" reveals my
Facebook password would take "*a desktop PC about 14 duodecillion years to
crack your password*"...however long that that is, but pretty sure it exceeds
the heat death of the universe!

So how do I do it?  I make the computer do the work for me.  In my case, I use
a program called "`1Password <https://agilebits.com/onepassword>`_" which is
great for me.  The idea is, you remember a single, good password to *unlock*
all the other passwords.  So whilst I don't know what most of my passwords
are, I remember the one password that my computer uses to securely store my
passwords.  This is a great concept and provided that one "master" password is
secure (mine is an entire sentence with extra "bits") your passwords are safe.

The down side is, 1Password isn't free and buying it can be a stumbling block
for some users.  However, I've come across a great tool called `Dashlane
Password Manager <https://www.dashlane.com/passwordmanager>`_.  Not only is
it **FREE** but it has nearly complete feature parity with 1Password!  The
more advanced features, like cloud backups etc, are a paid option but for home
users, this shouldn't be a huge problem.

So now there's no excuse to be using those crappy passwords on every site you
visit! `GO GET Dashlane Password Manager
