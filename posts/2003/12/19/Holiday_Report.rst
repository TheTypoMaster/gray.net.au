Well we're back from holidays!!  OK so Nat and I got away with our
friends Andrew and Ali Mathie, and Andrew's younger brother Tim. We
decided months ago a house boat might be fun so set about tracking
own some prices. We settled on `Clyde River House Boats <http://www.clyderiverhouseboats.com.au>`_
and I can honest say we weren't disappointed.

To save having to drive all the way from Wollongong to Batemans Bay on
the day we picked the boat up, we decided to drive down on the Sunday
and relax at a hotel/resort for one night. I can't remember the name
of the place but it was comfy, had a spa and came with breakfast. All
up a good choice by Andrew who booked it!
We rented the 8-10 berth boat which is essentially 4 bedrooms:

+ 2 x double bed rooms
+ 2 x double bunk rooms

You'll notice this adds up to 4 rooms, 8 sleeping locations - well the
other 2 are the sofa bed arrangement in the dining/lounge area.
Thankfully for us though, there was only five of us which left one of
the bunk rooms spare. Guess where all the fishing and skiing gear was
stored?

The house boat carried 2500L of fresh water which means plenty for hot
showers, flushing toilet and usual drinking and dish-washing duties.
It also came with a 240V generator to run the TV and video as well as
exterior flood lighting and the microwave. All up it was very well
equipped (see the web site above) and very comfortable.
We picked the boat up around lunch time on Monday 8th Dec, and
returned it at 9:30am on Friday 12th Dec. After a quick run around
with Robert (who runs Clyde River House Boats) we were ready to head
off up the river.

Driving a house boat is like trying to drive a car on ice - you turn
the wheel but nothing happens for loooong time! With the whole boat
weighing in at about 15 tonne (15,000kg = 33,000lb for the metric
impared) it took a while to work up to full speed and even longer to
slow to a stop. Made for interesting driving the first time we moored
up!

Without wanting to sound droll, our week away went something like
this:

- **7:30am** (ish) - Some people emerge, breakfast is eaten and
  quietness is maintained for the late risers.
- **9:00am** - Everyone is up by now and breakfast is done, dishes
  cleaned and ski's dragged out of "storage".
- **9:01am** - James and Nat go skiing. Andrew and Tim probably already
  out fishing. Ali taggs along with James and Nat coz they need an
  observer!
- **10:30am** (ish) - usually James and Nat are tuckered out from skiing
  so pack it all up. Ali can now start relaxing ;-)
- **12:00pm** (ish) - Lunch is had, Andrew and Tim make a brief visit
  before disappearing again in the tinnie. Ali, Nat and James now settle
  in for a relaxing afternoon reading, snoozing and listening to music
  (the house boat has a CD sound system through the whole boat!).
- **5:00pm** (ish) - fire up the gennie and start thinking about dinner.
  Tim and Andrew are back by now and the TV and Microwave are busy
  sucking that 240V. If we want to moore somewhere else for the night,
  we up anchor and move off about now too.
- **6:30pm** - Dinner is done, dishes cleaned packed away. Now the
  "shower relay" begins.
- **7:30pm** - shower relay is done and we see if there's anything worth
  watching on the idiot box. If not, it's either movie time (I did
  mention the VCR right?) and nibblies are dispersed. If we didn't feel
  like watching TV or a video, we usually stayed up playing dominos.
  Damn that makes us sound old!!
- **11:00pm** - bed time for most. Tim and Andrew were known to stay up
  watching movies though.

Rinse and repeat for 5 days :) Bliss.
