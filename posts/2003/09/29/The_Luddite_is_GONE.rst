Ah yes! Finally Austrlia has been liberated from the shackles of
Senator Alston! No more will we have to deal with a totally clueless
luser in charge of IT policy in our counrty. Maybe now telecos, ISP's,
broadcasters and other technologies will get the breathing space they
need to really push along! Maybe **now** we can get a reversal of the
digital TV debarcle, maybe **now** we can see widespread adoption of
true broad-band technologies...or maybe not.

Hold your breath folks - we don't know who is replacing Alston yet!!
(Sorry. Had to get that off my chest)
