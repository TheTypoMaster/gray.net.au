If you haven't seen "The Matrix Reloaded" then **DONT** read the rest
of this article. If you HAVE seen it, then here are my thought's on
Neo's meeting with "him". *Spoiler alert*

.. TEASER_END

Ok. Obviously "him" = "The Architect". So what are the thoughts?
Simple. The Architect says to Neo that he (Neo) is the sum of many
small anomolies inherrent in the Matrix. Essentially (for the non-
mathematical) if you divide 3 by 2, you get a remainder of 1. Neo is
the 1.

The Architect, also tells Neo this has happened before and in fact
there have been several "Neo's" and "Zion's" and all have followed the
same fate. However "this" Neo doesn't follow the same pattern as the
previous and decides to rescue Trinity and sacrifice Zion etc.
There are several things that have led me to believe what I am about
to say. If you've seen both the Matrix and Reloaded think about
everything the Oracle has said to Neo, think about Morpheus, Trinity
and the role of Zion. Think about what Agent Smith has said to Neo and
the "powers" he has inherited in Reloaded. Think about what the Oracle
said regarding rouge programs (eg, "The Twins" - do they rock or
what?!). Now think about this: Neo is **NOT** the anomoly described by
the Architect and the Oracle is right: without Neo, the humans are
doomed; desite the apparent destruction of Zion at the end of
"Reloaded".

So who , or what , is the anomoly? I propose Agent Smith. He fits the
profile for everything Neo is. Smith himself said to Neo, in the "100
Smiths" scene, that when Neo "destroyed" him in first movie that Neo
left some of himself behind. That is, the "new" agent Smith **IS** at
least in part, Neo as well. In programming terms; some of Neo's code
was "ported" to Smith.

So, kill Smith, and therefore zero the anomoly, the Matrix returns to
an equilibrium, the humans live and the machines are defeated.
Everyone lives happily ever after :-)

Or I could be completely wrong, and will look like an utter idiot when
"Revolutions" is out.....cest la vie.
