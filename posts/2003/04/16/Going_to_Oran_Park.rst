Yay! I'm booked and paid and going racing at Oran Park!!
My best mate Chris, another old school friend, Matt, and myself are
going "racing". Matt is going to bringing his MV Augusta to the track
for the first time and Chris is bikeless :-/

I'll be taking my camera and posting back some photo's when they're
developed. Until then, read about the ride day `here <http://www.cbr600rr.com.au/>`_. Follow the
links to the "Test ride the CBR600RR" on the flash page.
