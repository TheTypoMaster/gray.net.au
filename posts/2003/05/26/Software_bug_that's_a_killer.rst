We all know that buggy software is a pain (Windows 3.1 anyone??) but
what if your SCUBA computer had a bug that could kill you?!

This article lifted from `Slashdot <http://slashdot.org/>`_
A wrist computer that tracks and calculates safe diving times and
limits for SCUBA divers had a dangerous software bug that may have
been covered up by company executives. This `SF Chronicle <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/05/25/MN309974.DTL>`_
article details the product and the problem with it. According to
the Chron article, company execs tried to cover up and deny the
problem for years, but their `company website <http://www.uwatec.com/imperial/safety_notice.html>`_
makes it look like they did a voluntary recall.
