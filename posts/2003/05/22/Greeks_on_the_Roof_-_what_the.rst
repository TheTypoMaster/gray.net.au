Is it just me or is "Greeks on the Roof" just plain rubbish?
OK. I watched "Acropolis Now" during the 80's, hell I even thought
Effie was kinda hot! But what the hell is Channel 7 doing?
Being Greek at the moment seems to be very cool. With "My Big Fat
Greek Wedding" and all, who could blame them for having a little
national pride? We Aussies (aka "Skips") were doing the same thing
when Crocodile Dundee was doing the rounds.

Back to the latest "info-tainment" drivel..... Channel 7 have
recruited a great commedian "Effie", to host this show which was a
good choice but to basically take a 99.9% "The Kumars" rip-off, make
it Greek, screen it **at the same time** and not even trying to hide
these seems as though they actually want this show to fail!
I for one don't care much for either "The Kumars" or "Greeks on the
Roof" but I needed to vent this little angst where I knew it would be
published ;)

**UPDATE: 26-May-2003**
Seems a few people visiting this site have got this little rant all
wrong. This is **not** a winge about our Greek-Australian friends or
people with Greek origins in general. I have many friends of Greek
heritage. There are more idiot full-blood Aussies than Aussies with
Greek ethnicity in total! So please. Stop the e-mail with "you hate
Greeks...blah, blah, blah" because I dont! This was simply an
opportunity to **slag off at Channel 7**.
