Seems Linux advocates have taken the *Why Linux Sux?* album in the
gallery (edit: 2015 - gallery removed, please use the links below)
a little the wrong way. So let's just put it here for the record:

**I SUPPORT, USE AND PROMOTE LINUX!!**

I have made the full size screen shots available for download here:
  - `Tar+GZipped Version (Linux/OSX/Unix) </WhyLinuxSux.zip>`_
  - `Zipped Version (Windows) </WhyLinuxSux.tgz>`_

Ok. Stop the e-mail! I know what people are saying is partly true -
the "Why Linux Sux?" album is a bit of "bad press" for Linux. But
notice the "?" after the title? This is posed as a question: Yes why,
indeed, does Microsoft think Linux is bad for business?

A warrior is encouraged to "know thy enemy" and I advocate this
stance. Hence the reason I am hosting Microsoft's own sales education
material. As Linux promoters, we **need** to know what the
alternatives (sic) are in the same market space and what the promoters
of the alternatives are using to get an edge.

I use Linux professionally and also run a consultancy business to
specifically target and encourge small to medium business to invest in
open-source offerings such as Linux and/or FreeBSD etc. I was very
interested to learn about Microsoft's marketing tactics as I can now
more effectively sell **my** services and better promote free
(GPL/BSD) alternatives to directly counter the "opposition".

Having said all that I work for a company that has seen an increasing
role for open-source products in it's core infrastructure. In fact our
entire DNS, e-mail and web proxy infrastructure runs on a mix of Linux
and FreeBSD. Our CTO is a (was?) a BIG MS fan until we started doing
more with "obsoleted" hardware for less money than what the Microsoft
Marketdroids were quoting. We have almost won over the CTO on
expanding the reach of OSS alternatives. Not through being Linux
zealots, but rather proving that OSS can make a viable contribution to
the organisation. Let's drop the holy-war, and get back to doing what
OSS has always done best - making great software!! :-)
