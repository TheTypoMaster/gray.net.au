Sometimes the simple things are the things that irritate you the most,
or are the most poorly implemented solutions to a simple problem. Take
OSX's lack of a countdown timer - for me, a major pain in the butt.
However, a simple dashboard widget does a stellar job of implementing
this feature in an unobtrusive, elegant way. I give you (drum roll
please): `3-2-1`_- *no, that's not the countdown for the drum
roll...that's the software's name!*

Simple name, simple software - GREAT result. Kudos to the devs. Punch
in a time, hit the green square and return to your desktop. When the
timer runs out, dashboard takes focus and sounds a little
(customisable) sound. Voila.

So why the hell would someone need a countdown timer? Simple - the
next time you tell your wife, "I'll be about 10 minutes" then emerge
from your office, with bloodshot eyes, sore hands, a crick in your
neck and a bad odour several hours later, you'll remember this article
and download the freaking software! :) Or in my case, avoid the
situation in first place...honest.
