Well, after wrangling the old Geeklog and Gallery2 setup into complete
oblivion (my bad) I decided I'd had enough mokeying around with it and
have gone with a fork of the original Geeklog code - `GLFusion`_. The
really nice thing about GLFusion was that it was simple side-step from
the old CMS as the backed databases etc were practically identical!
Secondly, GLFusion integrates Mediagallery into the setup so I now
have a true integrated (as opposed to embedded) media system :) Woot.
Anyway, everyone's accounts are safe and the old content is all here.
Have a dig around and by all means tell me what you think - or leave
a comment to this post. Anyway, it's bloody late (or is that early)
and I need some sleep! Have fun people!
