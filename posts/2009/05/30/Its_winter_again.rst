Anyone who knows me, knows I hate the cold. Let's just ponder that for
a second. According to the dictionary, "hate ( *verb*) -to dislike
intensely or passionately; feel extreme aversion for or extreme
hostility toward; detest". Indeed, if it were possible to get hostile
with cold weather and make it retreat to be replaced with resplendent,
balmy, mid-thirty celsius with accompanying humidity, I'd go totally
Russell Crowe on today's offering from the `Bureau of Meteorology`_!!
Alas, I cannot - weather just doesn't work that way. So I will now
officially enter my annual period of sulking , until the weather
decides to bless us with warmth.

I hate the cold :(
