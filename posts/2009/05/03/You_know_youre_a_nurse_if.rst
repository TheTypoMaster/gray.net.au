With two nurses in my family (no, I'm NOT one of them!)I thought this
was rather funny having experienced many of these vicariously through
them!

.. TEASER_END

You know you're a nurse if...
-----------------------------

+ You believe that every patient needs tlc, diazepam,temazepam and
  haloperidol.
+ You would like to meet the inventor of the Nurse call buzzer some
  night in a dark alley.
+ You believe not all patients are annoying, some are unconscious.
+ Your sense of humour gets more warped each year.
+ You can only tell time by the 24 hr clock.
+ Almost everything can seem humorous....eventually.
+ When asked what colour that patients diarrheic was, you show them
  yourShoes.
+ You know the smell of different diarrhoea to identify it.
+ Every time you walk you make a jingling noise because of all
  theScissors and clamps in your pocket.
+ You can tell the pharmacist more about the medication they are
  dispensing than they know.
+ You carry more "spare" meds in your pocket rather than waiting for
  pharmacy to deliver them.
+ You refuse to watch ER because it is too much like the real thing
  and it triggers flashbacks.
+ You check the caller id on your day off to see if anyone from the
  hospital is trying to call and ask you to work.
+ You've been telling stories in a restaurant and made someone at
  another table throw up.
+ notice that you are using more 4 letter words than you did before
  you started nursing.
+ Everytime someone asks you for a pen you can find at least 4 of them
  on you.
+ You can intubate your friends at parties.
+ You don't get excited about blood unless it's your own.
+ You live by the motto "to be right is only half the battle, to
  convince the doctor is more difficult"
+ You've basted your thanksgiving turkey with a nasogastric syringe.
+ You've told a confused patient that your name was that of your co-
  worker and to holler if they need help.
+ Eating microwave popcorn out of a clean bedpan is perfectly normal.
+ Your bladder can expand to the size of a Mack Truck's Radiator Sump.
+ When checking the level of a patients orientation you aren't sure of
  the answer.
+ You find yourself checking out other customers veins in grocery
  waiting lines.
+ You can sleep soundly at the hospital cafeteria table on your dinner
  break and not be embarrassed when you wake up.
+ You avoid unhealthy looking shoppers in the mall for fear that they
  will drop near you and you'll have to do cpr on your day off.
+ You have ever referred to someone's death as a transfer to the
  "Eternal Care Unit".
+ You have ever wanted to hold a seminar entitled "Suicide ... Doing
  It Right".
+ You have ever had a patient look you straight in the eye and say "I
  have no idea how that got stuck in there".

  laugh uncontrollably.

  as a lemon-aid pitcher and use a bed sheet for a tablecloth

  reproduce.
+ You hate to get dressed in "real clothes" because scrubs are what
  you live in and why can't they make jeans that comfortable.
+ You have ever restrained someone and it was not a sexual experience.
+ Your most common assessment question is "what changed tonight to
  make it an emergency after 6 hours / days / weeks / months / years)?".
+ You often stay awake for 24+ hrs at a time when you work nights
  realize you don't need alcohol or drugs to hallucinate just lack
  ofsleep...
+ You pull over in some parking lot after working nights because you
  are too tired to drive home and wake up to someone knocking on your
  window thinking you have had a stroke because you are passed out in
  your car and drooling.
