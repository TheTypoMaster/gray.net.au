Go figure. I have two Macs; a Macbook Pro and an iMac. Both Intel
CPU's, both with lots of hard drive and memory...life is good.
However, I thought there was enough water under the bridge to give
Safari 4 Beta a run and the reviews about speed and features over
Safari 3 were extremely enticing. So given the Macbook Pro was the
least critical of the two boxes, I upgraded to OSX 10.5.7 and made
sure everything was peachy - it was. Next upgraded to Safari 4 Beta.
Wow! It's fast, stable, has a really cool "Top Sites" tab (that comes
up when I open a new tab, and many other features you can read about
elsewhere.

Next was the iMac's turn.The OSX 10.5.7 upgrade went without a hitch,
as did the Safari 4 install. However, unlike the Macbook, Mail on the
iMac now crashes when fetching RSS feeds (I use Mail as my RSS
aggregator) and the box says "Hey don't blame Apple, it was
GrowlMail's fault!!"...and it is. I uninstalled the GrowlMail bundle
from my ~/Library/Mail/Bundles directory, and everything is working
again (except Growl notifying me of new mail). I can live with that.

So it's over to the Growl devs (who normally respond fairly quickly to
this sort of thing) - FIXIT!!:-/
