These are purported to be actual excerpts from letters sent to
councils and housing associations throughout the UK...and Poms think
Aussies are uncultured!

.. TEASER_END

#. I want some repairs done to my cooker as it has backfired and burnt
   my knob off.
#. I wish to complain that my father hurt his ankle very badly when he
   put his foot in the hole in his back passage.
#. And their 18 year old son is continually banging his balls against
   my fence.
#. I wish to report that the tiles are missing from the outside toilet
   roof. I think it was that bad wind the other night that blew them off.
#. I am writing on behalf of my sink, which is coming away from the
   wall.
#. Will you please send someone to mend the garden path, my wife
   tripped and fell on it yesterday and now she is pregnant?
#. I request permission to remove my drawers in the kitchen. 50% of
   the walls are damp, 50% have crumbling plaster and the rest are plain
   filthy.
#. The toilet is blocked and we cannot bath the children until it is
   cleared.
#. Will you please send a man to look at my water? It is a funny
   colour and not fit to drink.
#. Our lavatory seat is broken in half and is now in three pieces.
#. I want to complain about the farmer across the road, every morning
   at 6:00am his *censored*wakes me up and its now getting too much for
   me.
#. The man next door has a large erection in the garden, which is
   unsightly and dangerous.
#. Our kitchen floor is damp. We have two small children and would
   like a third so please send someone round to do something about it.
#. I am a single woman living in a downstairs flat and would you
   please do something about the noise made by the man I have on top of
   me every night.
#. Please send a man with the right tool to finish the job and satisfy
   my wife.
#. I have had the clerk of the works down on the floor six times but I
   still have had no satisfaction.
#. My bush is really overgrown round the front and my back passage has
   fungus in it.
#. He's got this huge tool that vibrates the whole house and I just
   can't take it any more.
