Right now I'm too angry to see straight! My entire stock of fish in my
marine tank are dying. Let's put this in perspective: that's a
breeding pair of clowns, two domino damsels, 3 blue chromis, a rainbow
wrasse and a coral banded shrimp. At risk are myanemone, and beautiful
crop soft corals and about 50kg of live rock. All up about $1000
dollar investment. So how did this happen? Simple. I purchased the two
damsels and a coral banded shrimp from a store I don't normally buy
stock from, and lo and behold, they don't protect their customers from
parasites, viruses and bacterial infection which subsequently ended up
in my tank!! The death toll so far (since Sunday):

+ Tuesday: the rainbow wrasse and a damsel
+ Wednesday: one clown with the other clown looking like he's circling
  the drain. Second damsel showing signs of distress.

Moral to the story: only buy stock from suppliers who QUARANTINE their
new stock and treat them with at least some sort of copper solution
prior to sale. Apparently the mob I purchased from on Sunday don't
care about their stock OR their customers!! Hopefully the guy I
normally purchase from, who's a top bloke and great supplier, might
allow me to quarantine my corals and anemone in one of his quarantine
tanks while I clean my tank up. If not, add another $150 to the
potential loss :( Right now the only indications I have are some very
fine white marks on the fish bodies then about 12-24 hours later, they
die. Whatever is killing my fish is FAST and it isn't "ich" - despite
the white spots. Ich doesn't kill this fast. My guess is some sort of
virus or maybe a bacterial infection. It's too fast to be parasitic
(which rules out ich).

Like I said - so angry I can hardly see straight!!
