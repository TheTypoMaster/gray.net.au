I was flying my freshly built Yak-54 foamie down the park, miles (ok,
several hundred metres) from anything solid and upright. Not long into
the flying, during a gentle left turn the ailerons stopped working -
not good with about 50% deflection and full-span ailerons! Tried
recovery with opposite rudder and a lot of elevator but no dice. The
damned thing went into an inverted spin and didn't recover. Lucky for
me, some kind farmer had left a line of star pickets with barbed wire
to arrest the descent!!! Grrr. Anyone got some glue???
