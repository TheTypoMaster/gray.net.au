Found this in today's news from Fairfax media:

*"January 11, 2009 Eamonn Duff*

*USERS of the Cross City Tunnel have been warned of the risk of needles
being dropped by drug addicts who frequent a Sydney suburb directly
above.*

*Syringe signs have been installed along the southbound ramp connecting
the tunnel and the Eastern Distributor.*

*A tunnel spokesman said the signs were erected because an area in
Darlinghurst directly above the partially-roofed link had become "a
hot spot for injecting".*

*"Syringes are frequently disposed [of] in this area, causing a
potential safety hazard," the spokesman said.*

*The laneway, between Palmer and Bourke streets, has attracted users
since it was created as a result of the tunnel's construction in 2005.*

*At night, drug users congregate along the dimly lit path to inject
drugs including heroin and ice."*

`Original source`_.

I can see it now, some poor bastard on a motorbike (more likely a
scooter) innocently meandering their way through the catastrophe that
is Sydney's 24hr traffic madness, happens upon this stretch of road.
All of a sudden, BAM !!! They have a used needle sticking out of their
neck. In this situation, I wonder who is liable? The council? The
tunnel operators? The police?All of the above? None of that really
matters when the scooter rider lucks out on their way home at dark
o'clock and now has to deal with potentially any, and every, known
nasty bug that courses through the collective veins of drug users.

I'm glad for 2 things after reading this:


#. I don't work in Syndey any more, and
#. I don't ride a motorbike anymore


...although I do miss my bike :( Take care out there people, next the
whole drug addict will fall from the sky, and they tend to annoy car
drivers as much as motorcyclists.
