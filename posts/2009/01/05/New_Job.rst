New year, new job! I think I've hit the jackpot in relation to
Wollongong employers; I now work for `Australian Health Management
(ahm)`_ as the Senior Systems and Network Engineer for the
Infrastructure group (yeh...that's a real mouthful eh?). This has been
a long time coming and I am thrilled to be given the opportunity to
work in Wollongong for such a large and successful company. The people
I work with are just wonderful, and the culture is a privilige to be
part of.

Although it's early days (*my first week*) I really believe I can make a
valuable contribution here and my skills are genuinely valued. I don't
want to sound like a roving advertisement but I'm just so excited to
be working here!!
