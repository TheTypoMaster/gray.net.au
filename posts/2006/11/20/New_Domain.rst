You may have noticed that The Gray Matter has a new domain. I've
registered "gray.net.au " recently and have now moved everything to
the new domain. Along with the new domain, I have installed a new (and
vastly improved) gallery to house all our photos. As before, only
registered users can see the full-size images in most of the galleries,
so if you haven't already registered, now is a good time! Let me know
if you find any broken links or weird happenings...there were plenty
over the weekend and I can guarantee I haven't nailed all the bugs :P
