I don't normally broadcast when we're heading away for a week or so (I
have to think about the security of my unoccupied house!) so I'm
announcing our *return* from Cairns! We decided that it was a good
time to steal a week and see my parents and my brother and his family.
Considering my girls hadn't seen their "Pa" since early this year, and
Elise had never met him, it was a great trip purely from that
perspective. We got up to other things too...

It was a very short and hastily planned trip. The reason? Simple, I
had a very short break between leaving my job at `OCS`_ before
starting my new job at `DOT Communications`_. So we bundled up the
girls and jumped a flight to Cairns for a number of reasons. Firstly,
so we could take a break, and secondly to introduce Elise to her
Grandfather, and her Uncle David, Auntie Kate, and cousins Angus and
Samuel.

As a bounus we were up there just after my mum's birthday so we ALL
went out for dinner. It was a great time and it was such a privilege
to have all of us together for a meal.

The rest of the week was spent just relaxing and drinking *far* too
much coffee! Still, we had a great time and thoroughly enjoyed
ourselves. The girls were spoilt rotten by their Nanna and Pa, but
what the heck! That's what Nanna's and Pa's are for!

The other thing I got up to was to join my brother as a guest on his
weekly podcast; `Global Geek Podcast`_. It was a real eye-opener to
how much work he puts into it and just how passionate he is about it.
I had a great time putting my opinions out there and giving Dave a
hard time "on air". If you're interested in technology, but don't like
it being "technical" then you'd probably get a real kick out of Dave's
podcast; he and his co-host "Knightwise" cover the previous week;s
tech news from the perspective of a normal "user" which is a really
novel approach to it. So give it a go and listen in - I do!! :)
