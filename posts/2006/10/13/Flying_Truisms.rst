**FLYING TRUISMS**

- Basic Flying Rules
    #. Try to stay in the middle of the air.
    #. Do not go near the edges of it.
    #. The edges of the air can be recognised by the appearance of ground,
       buildings, sea, trees and interstellar space. It is much more
       difficult to fly there.

- When one engine fails on a twin-engine airplane you always have
  enough power left to get you to the scene of the crash.
- Blue water Navy truism; There are more planes in the ocean than
  there are submarines in the sky.
- Never trade luck for skill.
- The three most common expressions (or famous last words) in aviation
  are, "Why is it doing that?"; "Where are we?" and " Ooh *censored*!"
- Weather forecasts are horoscopes with numbers.
- Progress in airline flying; Now a flight attendant can get a pilot
  pregnant.
- Airspeed, altitude or brains. Two are always needed to successfully
  complete the flight.
- A smooth landing is mostly luck; two in a row is all luck; three in
  a row is prevarication.
- I remember when sex was safe and flying was dangerous.
- Mankind has a perfect record in aviation; we never left one up
  there!
- If the wings are traveling faster than the fuselage, it's probably a
  helicopter-and therefore, unsafe.
- Flashlights are tubular metal containers kept in a flight bag for
  the purpose of storing dead batteries.
- Navy carrier pilots to Air Force pilots: Flaring is like squatting
  to pee.
- Flying the airplane is more important than radioing your plight to a
  person on the ground incapable of understanding it or doing anything
  about it.
- When a flight is proceeding incredibly well, something was
  forgotten.
- Just remember, if you crash because of weather, your funeral will be
  held on a sunny day.
- Advice given to RAF pilots during W.W.II. When a prang (crash) seems
  inevitable, endeavor to strike the softest, cheapest object in the
  vicinity as slowly and gently as possible.
- The Piper Cub is the safest airplane in the world; it can just
  barely kill you. (Attributed to Max Stanley, Northrop test pilot)
- A pilot who doesn't have any fear probably isn't flying his plane to
  its maximum. (Jon McBride, astronaut)
- If you're faced with a forced landing, fly the thing as far into the
  crash as possible. (Bob Hoover - renowned aerobatic pilot)
- If an airplane is still in one piece, don't cheat on it; ride the
  bastard down. (Ernest K. Gann, author & aviator)
- Though I Fly Through the Valley of Death I Shall Fear No Evil For I
  am at 80,000 Feet and Climbing (sign over the entrance to the SR-71
  operating location Kadena, Japan).
- You've never been lost until you've been lost at Mach 3. (Paul F.
  Crickmore - test pilot)
- Never fly in the same cockpit with someone braver than you.
- There is no reason to fly through a thunderstorm in peacetime (sign
  over squadron ops desk at Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ, 1970).
- The three best things in life are a good landing, a good orgasm, and
  a good bowel movement. The night carrier landing is one of the few
  opportunities in life where you get to experience all three at the
  same time. (Author unknown, but someone who's been there)
- "Now I know what a dog feels like watching TV." (A DC-9 captain
  trainee attempting to check out on the 'glass cockpit' of an
  A-320).
- What is the similarity between air traffic controllers and pilots?
  If a pilot screws up, the pilot dies; if ATC screws up, the pilot
  dies.
- Without ammunition the USAF would be just another expensive flying
  club.
- If something hasn't broken on your helicopter, it's about to.
- You know that your landing gear is up and locked when it takes full
  power to taxi to the terminal.
