Well, it was bound to happen. The blogs and links and stuff have
attracted search engines to this site like flies to a BBQ!
Consequently, I've had to slightly restrict the high-bandwidth
sections to save my connection.

To see the full-size (original) photos in the galleries, you now MUST
LOG IN! Sorry about this, but it's the only consistent way I have of
allowing "real" people to see anything they want, but preventing
search engines leeching massive amounts of bandwidth. In short, search
engines are stupid bloody things that simply follow links, keeping
track of what is linking to where and ranking stuff depending on many
things. Problem: the gallery links like this:
Thumbnail -> Intermediate -> Full Size -> Intermediate -> Full Size...
etc

See the problem? Even though the search engine has absolutely *no*
interest in the image itself (well, ok, `Google Images`_ does) it
transfers the entire 1MB file, every time it requests the full size
link! Rinse and repeat every few seconds and you can imagine the sort
of bandwidth I'm chewing.

Ordinarily this wouldn't be a problem - it's an upload from the
perspective of my network and most ISP's don't give a furry freckle
about uploads. My link (due to its wireless nature) is almost
impossible to differentiate uploads from downloads, so I get a block
quota. This quota is VERY generous, but still, there's no point
wasting it on search engines requesting files/images they have
absolutely NO interest in.
