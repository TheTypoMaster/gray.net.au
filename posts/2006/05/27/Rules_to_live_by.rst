Here's 22 simple rules and insights that if you follow will make so
much more comfortable (or at least explain a lot of the crap that goes
on anyway).

#. Everyone has a photographic memory. Some don't have film.
#. He who laughs last, thinks slowest.
#. A day without sunshine is like, well, night.
#. On the other hand, you have different fingers.
#. Change is inevitable, except from a vending machine.
#. Back up my hard drive? How do I put it in reverse?
#. I just got lost in thought. It was unfamiliar territory.
#. Light travels faster than sound. This is why some people appear
   bright until you hear them speak.
#. Seen it all, done it all, can't remember most of it.
#. Those who live by the sword get shot by those who don't.
#. Just remember... if the world didn't suck, we'd all fall off.
#. The 50-50-90 rule: Anytime you have a 50-50 chance of getting
   something right, there's a 90% probability you'll get wrong.
#. It is said that if you line up all the cars in the world end to
   end, someone would be stupid enough to try and pass them.
#. You can't have everything, where would you put it?
#. Latest survey shows that 3 out of 4 people make up 75% of the
   world's population.
#. If the shoe fits, get another one just like it.
#. The things that come to those that wait may be the things left by
   those who got there first.
#. Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach a man to fish
   and he will sit in a boat all day drinking beer.
#. Flashlight: A case for holding dead batteries.
#. A fine is a tax for doing wrong. A tax is a fine for doing well.
#. I started out with nothing and I still have most of it.
#. When you go into court you are putting yourself in the hands of 12
   people that weren't smart enough to get out of jury duty!
