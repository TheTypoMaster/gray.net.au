It was recently my birthday and my lovely (long suffering) wife bought
me an electronic weather station. WOOT! Not just *any* weather station
mind you...one that hooks up to my computer :)

.. TEASER_END

If that was where this story ended it'd be reaonably dull. Actually,
it wouldn't be worth a mention. The significance is that for a long
time a good friend of mine (let's call him "Mike"...coz that's his
name) and I have had a facination for meterological statistics. He's
already got `some rudimentary stats`_ on the go. This is all hand-
rolled code that Mike put together. However, we want more!

So enter `my weather station`_. Now make no mistake - this is one very
impressive package. It measures (and tracks) indoor and outdoor
temperature and humidity, barometric presure, rainfall (to withing
0.1mm!), wind speed (to 0.1km/h) and wind direction. From that it
derives dew point, wind chill, and other key weather indicators. Now
that all this is being *sensed* we can start creating all the code to
do the most sweet funky graphs and trends :)

The code is already starting to take shape and we've hashed out a
number of key logic and functionality type issues and are laying the
groundwork for the bulk of the project. We're not setting ourselves
any deadlines, but expect to see more information appearing on this
website as the ideas take form into code. My first plan is to get some
photos of the station up, then get the basic data displaying in
numeric form. Then we'll work on the trend graphs and analysis.

I guess all that meterology I studied for my flying training is
finally going to go to something useful (since leaving the flying
industry anyway!). STAY TUNED!!
