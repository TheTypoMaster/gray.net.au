Gah - whilst trying to help out a friend, I inadvertently modified the
firewall rules to lock everything out while I was working remotely.  Long
story short - when flushing the firewall rules, set the default policy to
*accept* unless you have physical access to revert to working config!
Otherwise (like today) you not only lock out intruders, you take out your
connection you were using to manage the firewall, and can't reconnect to fix
it!! **DOH!**  Apologies to all. *(See, even us Ã¼ber nerds get it wrong
occasionally!)*
