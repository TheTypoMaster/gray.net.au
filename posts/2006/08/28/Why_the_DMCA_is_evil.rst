Normally I don't write articles about technology news - there's plenty
of others doing that and besides, I don't want to compete with my
brother over at the `Rooster's Rail`_! ( *Hi Dave*). However, this
time, I'm making an exception because it affects Australia, and more
importantly, the average "Joe" on the street.

There's this nasty piece of legislation in the USA called the `Digital
Millennium Copyright Act`_ (DMCA). They (the USA) are keen to see it
spread. The way they are doing it is by wrapping it up in trade
agreements other countries sign in order to trade with the USA.
Australia sold out it's copyrights to the USA in our most recent trade
agreement. Now it seems Canada is going down a similar road.

Nothing news worthy there, and lets face it - who wants to actually
*read* the DMCA to try and figure out why it is so damn evil?! Not me!
So `Michael Giest`_ has written a really good day-by-day count down to
Canada's DMCA adoption called `30 days of DRM`_ (DRM is `Digital
Rights Management`_ and is the practical working of the DMCA). It's
easy to read and rather startling once you realise how invasive,
restrictive and dangerous the DMCA is to average people and how they
use different forms of media. Please read Michael Geist's page.

So you've read about the DMCA and want to make some noise? Sure, go
sign up with `Defective by Design`_ who campaign against DRM and the
DMCA in all its forms. Mainly centred in the USA, by they organise
demonstrations, petitions etc, where ever there are enough people. So
go sign up, get involved and let these media outlets know what the
consumers think of being told what they cn and can't do with the media
they paid for in good faith!
