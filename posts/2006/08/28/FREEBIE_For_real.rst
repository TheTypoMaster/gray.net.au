Just a very short article to link to one of the best FREE virus
scanners I've seen to date. Written by a company called "Comodo" their
antivirus product is free and extemely featurful. So go and get it! No
excuses now for not having a good virus scanner.
`Comodo Antivirus`_

:From Comodo's web site:
    *"Comodo AntiVirus 1.1 beta, subsequent beta versions, and the final
    release version will each be available to businesses and home users at
    no charge. After installing the program, just register with us and you
    will be sent a free license. Once activated, this license will never
    expire.*

    *Unlike some vendors that offer stripped down versions of commercial
    products for free, this is the full, completely functional version of
    the product."*
