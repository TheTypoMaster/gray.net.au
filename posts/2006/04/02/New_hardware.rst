The process has begun! Today I lashed out and bought a new Mac Mini
(Intel Core Duo) and with the help of my good friend Mike, moved The
Gray Matter onto the new kit. Page generation has been cut down to
about quarter of the old setup and I still haven't got around to
upping the RAM to 1GB! Enjoy the newer faster site.
