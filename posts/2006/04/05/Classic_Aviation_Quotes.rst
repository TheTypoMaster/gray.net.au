I've seen these before but I lost my copy of them, so I've put them up
here for future generations to read and enjoy! Basically they are
announcements and quotes made over intercoms on domestic flights. Are
the true? *Who cares!* They're funny!

.. TEASER_END

+ On a Continental Flight with a very "senior" flight attendant crew,
  the pilot said, "Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached cruising altitude
  and will be turning down the cabin lights. This is for your comfort
  and to enhance the appearance of your flight attendants."
+ Heard on a Southwest Airline flight. "Ladies and gentlemen, if you
  wish to smoke, the smoking section on this airplane is on the wing and
  if you can light 'em, you can smoke 'em."
+ On landing, the stewardess said, "Please be sure to take all of your
  belongings. If you're going to leave anything, please make sure it's
  something we'd like to have."
+ As the plane landed and was coming to a stop at Ronald Reagan, a
  lone voice came over the loudspeaker, "Whoa, big fella. Whoa!"
+ After a particularly rough landing during thunderstorms in Memphis,
  a flight attendant on a Northwest flight announced, "Please take care
  when opening the overhead compartments because, after a landing like
  that, I'm sure everything has shifted."
+ From a Southwest Airlines employee. "Welcome aboard Southwest flight
  245 to Tampa. To operate your seat belt, insert the metal tab into the
  buckle and pull tight. It works just like every other seat belt and if
  you don't know how to operate one, you probably shouldn't be out in
  public unsupervised."
+ "In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure, masks will descend
  from the ceiling. Stop screaming, grab the mask and pull it over your
  face. If you have a small child travelling with you, secure your mask
  before assisting with theirs. If you are travelling with more than one
  small child, pick your favourite."
+ Weather at our destination is 50 degrees with some broken clouds,
  but we'll try to have them fixed before we arrive. Thank you, and
  remember, nobody loves you, or your money, more than Southwest
  Airlines."
+ "Your seat cushions can be used for flotation and in the event of an
  emergency water landing, please paddle to shore and take them with our
  compliments."
+ "As you exit the plane, make sure to gather all of your belongings.
  Anything left behind will be distributed evenly among the flight
  attendants. Please do not leave children or spouses."
+ And from the pilot during his welcome message. "Delta Airlines is
  pleased to have some of the best flight attendants in the industry.
  Unfortunately, none of them are on this flight!"
+ Heard on Southwest Airlines just after a very hard landing in Salt
  Lake City. The flight attendant came on the intercom and said, "That
  was quite a bump and I know what y'all are thinking. I'm here to tell
  you it wasn't the airline's fault, it wasn't the pilot's fault, it
  wasn't the flight attendant's fault, it was the asphalt."
+ Overheard on an American Airlines flight into Amarillo, Texas on a
  particularly windy and bumpy day. During the final approach, the
  captain was really having to fight it. After an extremely hard
  landing, the flight attendant said, "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
  Amarillo. Please remain in your seats with your seat belts fastened
  while the Captain taxis what's left of our air plane to the gate!"
+ Another flight attendant's comment on a less than perfect landing.
  "We ask you to please remain seated as Captain Kangaroo bounces us to
  the terminal."
+ An airline pilot wrote that on this particular flight he had
  hammered his ship into the runway really hard. The airline had a
  policy which required the first officer to stand at the door while the
  passengers exited, smile and give them a "Thanks for flying our
  airline." He said that, in light of his bad landing, he had a hard
  time looking the passengers in the eye, thinking that someone would
  have a smart comment. Finally everyone had gotten off except for a
  little old lady walking with a cane. She said, "Sir, do you mind if I
  ask you a question"? "Why, no,Ma'am," said the pilot. "What is it?"
  The little old lady said, "Did we land or were we shot down"?
+ After a real crusher of a landing in Phoenix, the attendant came on
  the horn, " Ladies and gentlemen, please remain in your seats until
  Captain Crash and the Crew have brought the aircraft to a screeching
  halt against the gate. And, once the tire smoke has cleared and the
  warning bells are silenced, we'll open the door and you can pick your
  way through the wreckage to the terminal."
+ Part of a flight attendant's arrival announcement. "We'd like to
  thank you folks for flying with us today. And, the next time you get
  the insane urge to go blasting through the skies in a pressurised
  metal tube, we hope you'll think of U.S. Airways."
+ A plane was taking off from Kennedy Airport. After it reached a
  comfortable cruising altitude, the captain made an announcement over
  the intercom, "Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.
  Welcome to flight number 293, non stop from New York to Los Angeles.
  The weather ahead is good and, therefore, we should have a smooth and
  uneventful flight. Now sit back and relax. Oh, my gosh! Silence
  followed, and after a few minutes, the captain came back on the
  intercom and said, "Ladies and gentlemen, I am so sorry if I scared
  you earlier. While I was talking to you, the flight attendant
  accidentally spilled a cup of hot coffee in my lap. You should see the
  front of my pants!" A passenger in coach yelled, "That's nothing. You
  should see the back of mine!"
