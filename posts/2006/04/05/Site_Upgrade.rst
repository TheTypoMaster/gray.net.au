I've just finished upgrading the content management system for The
Gray Matter. This new version adds a few cool features from an
administration point of view and fixes a number of annoying little
bugs for users too. For instance, you can now leave a message from the
main body of a story by hitting the "Reply" button at the end of the
story, without having to go back to the story list and clicking on the
"Post a Comment" link. Same restrictions still apply though (like
having to log in to leave comments etc). Enjoy!
