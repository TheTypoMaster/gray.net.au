On the left hand side you will now see some information about the
local weather here at the Gray Matter. The inside temp/humidity is my
study, and the outside values are whatever the sensors are reading on
my TV antenna. Photos soon! (*I promise!!*).

For now, just enjoy watching the numbers - they refresh every three
minutes, so no point hammering the refresh/reload button at your end
ok?!
