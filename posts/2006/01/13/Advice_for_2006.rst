#. DON'T waste money on expensive iPods. Simply think of your
   favourite tune and hum it. If you want to "switch tracks", simply
   think of another song you like and hum that instead.
#. CINEMA goers: Please have consideration for pirate DVD viewers by
   having a p*ss before the film starts.
#. RAPPERS: Avoid having to say 'know what I'm sayin' all the time by
   actually speaking clearly in the first place.
#. DON'T waste money on expensive paper shredders to avoid having your
   identity stolen. Simply place a few dog turds in the bin bags along
   with your old bank statements.
#. WORRIED that your teeth will be stained after a heavy night
   drinkingred wine? Simply drink a bottle of white wine before going to
   bed to remove the stains.
#. MURDERERS: Need to dispose of a body? Simply parcel it up and post
   it to yourself via DHL. You will never see it again.
#. EMPLOYERS: Avoid hiring unlucky people by immediately tossing half
   the CVs into the bin.
#. ALCOHOL: Makes an ideal substitute for happiness.
#. MEN: When listening to your favourite CD, simply turn up the sound
   to the volume you desire; then turn it down three notches. This will
   save your wife from having to do it.
#. GAMBLERS: For a new gambling opportunity, try sending $50 to
   yourself by NZ Post.
#. BLIND PEOPLE: Give yourself at least a chance of seeing something
   by not wearing heavy dark glasses all the time.
#. DRIVERS: If a car breaks down or stalls in front of you, beep your
   horn and wave your arms frantically. This should help the car start
   andsend them on their way.
#. PREVENT burglars stealing everything in the house by simply moving
   everything in the house into your bedroom when you go to bed. In
   themorning, simply move it all back again.
#. CAR THIEVES: Don't be discouraged when nothing is on view. All the
   valuables may be hidden in the glove box or under a seat.
#. DEPRESSED people: Instead of attempting suicide as a 'cry for
   help'; simply shout 'Help!' thus saving money on paracetamol, etc.
#. MOTORISTS: Avoid getting prosecuted for using your phone whilst
   driving. Simply pop you're mobile inside a large shell and the police
   will think you are listening to the sea.
#. SINGLE men: Convince people that you have a girlfriend by standing
   outside a supermarket with several bags of shopping, looking at
   yourwatch and occasionally glancing inside.
#. BOIL an egg to perfection without costly egg timers by popping the
   egg into boiling water and driving away from your home at exactly
   60mph. After 3 miles, phone your wife and tell her to take the egg out
   the pan.
#. ALCOHOLICS: don't worry where the next drink is coming from. Go to
   the pub, where a large selection is available at retail prices.
#. McDONALD'S: Make your brown carrier bags green in colour so they
   blend in with the countryside after they've been thrown out of
   carwindows.
#. WOMEN: Don't waste energy faking orgasms. Most men couldn't give a
   damn anyway and you could use the saved energy to vacuum the
   houseafterwards.
