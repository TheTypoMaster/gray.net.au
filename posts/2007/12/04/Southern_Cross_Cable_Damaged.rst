I've just received an e-mail from an ISP we manage at work that the
Southern Cross Cable has been damaged due to storm activity. So if
anyone notices a slow-down between Australia and the USA, this would
explain it. I will be curious to see if InterNode's investment in
bandwidth via Asia to the USA shields their customers from this most
recent Southern Cross dilemma. Internoders.....comments??
