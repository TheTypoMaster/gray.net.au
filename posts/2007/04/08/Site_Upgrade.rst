Happy Easter! Welcome to the new and improved Gray Matter. What? You
can't tell the difference? Sheesh! The lack of gratitude is insulting
:P Seriously though, all the changes are in the back-end and have very
little effect on how the site looks. The upgrade has vastly improved
spam detection for comments and track-backs along with a number of
other security fixes. Kudos to all the developers over at `Geeklog!`_
I've also clarified the copyright for all the work on this site and
added a short warning to all potential bandwidth leechers on the
'About Us' page. You leech, your site will have a referrer ban
slapped on it :)
Anyway, just wanted to put a quick note to explain the downtime
yesterday (if anyone noticed) and say happy easter! Take care y'all.
