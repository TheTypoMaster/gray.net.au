I'm not going to bore everyone with stuff they've read elsewhere. This
is purely my first impressions for the sake of posterity. So with no
more intro, here it is, my top five new features in Leopard/iLife '08
I can't live without.

.. TEASER_END

#. **Spaces**. Some people hate them, I can't live without them.
   Organise my work spaces into logical areas in a virtual space. Make
   sense? No? Tough. Get a Mac!
#. **iPhoto '08**. Nothing revolutionary in the product but a nice
   evolution from the '06 iteration I've been used to. The interface is a
   lot more intuitive and polished. Now to find another plugin that will
   allow me to upload directly into the galleries here at the Gray Matter
   and I'll be set.
#. **Tabbed terminals**. We've all (by now) seen tabbed browsers and
   Unix environments (KDE/Gnome/Enlightenment/et al) have had tabbed
   terminals for a long time. It's so good to have the same functionality
   in OSX. Now I can open one terminal program and run many shells
   without cluttering up my work space. W00t.
#. **Apple Mail**. The new RSS integration is superbly done and well
   integrated. I can now read my RSS feeds just as easily as my e-mail.
   This totally kicks butt.
#. **Speed**. It's faster than Leopard from a purely subjective point of
   view. Applications open faster, switching between apps is snappy
   without significant lag, boot up and shutdown is not painful. All
   round, even with all the eye-candy, the whole system *feels* faster.

Another noteable mention is the "stacks" feature which greatly reduces
clutter in the dock. Don't know what I'm talking about? Then get a mac
:P Seriously, you wont regret it.

I'm not going the end with *"insert non-Mac system here"* bashing, but
I will say that in terms of intuitive interface, usability/features
out-of-the-box, speed and overall " *polish*" Leopard makes the other
offerings in the market today look decidedly dated. Vista looks good,
don't get me wrong, but damn(!!) could BE any slower? Linux (the
desktop distributions) are fantastic for out-of-the-box features and
productivity tools but compatibility problems with new and/or exotic
hardware can make getting going non-trivial, especially for the new
Linux user.

Compatibility is really a moot point on OSX; if you don't own a Mac
then you can't install it (without some serious hacking). That in a
lot of ways is what so good, and at the same time bad about OSX -
Apple never have to worry about obscure hardware combinations, but if
you don't like their hardware, there aren't a lot of options to modify
specifications greatly. If they didn't build it, you're on your own.
Microsoft and Linux are in a totally different world of pain having to
ensure support for all manner of different components, and *then*
having to make sure they all play nice together, which we all know is
easier said than done. I'm not convinced that Vista would be selling
as well as it is if it weren't for the OEM market bundling deals that
Microsoft have done - regardless of the legality or "fairness" of
those deals (I'm not going into that...most people know my thoughts).

But I digress. Leopard is everything we were promised for the next
iteration of OSX; Apple did not disappoint. However, initially the
annoucement was OSX and iLife would be bundled and not be separate
products once Leopard hit the market. This didn't happen. My only
guess is that after seeing what was on offer in Vista, Steve Jobs
decided there was no good business or marketing reasons to bundle the
two cash-cows for Apple to remain competitive. Who knows. Even so, the
purchase price for OSX+iLife is still significantly less than a
comparable Vista bundle and you get arguably the *best* desktop
operating system available, period. I'm one very happy Mac user.
