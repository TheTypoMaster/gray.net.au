I've seen this before, but it arrived in my mailbox today from a friend. Given
my previous employment in the aviation industry and my current career in
information technology, I think this is a great cross-over :) Enjoy!

.. TEASER_END

UNIX Airways
------------

Everyone brings one piece of the plane along when they come to the airport.
They all go out on the runway and put the plane together piece by piece,
arguing nonstop about what kind of plane they are supposed to be building.

Air DOS
-------

Everybody pushes the airplane until it glides, then they jump on and let the
plane coast until it hits the ground again. Then they push again, jump on
again, and so on.

Mac Airlines
------------

All the stewards, captains, baggage handlers, and ticket agents look and act
exactly the same. Every time you ask questions about details, you are gently
but firmly told that you don't need to know, don't want to know, and
everything will be done for you without your ever having to know, so just shut
up.

Windows Air
-----------

The terminal is pretty and colorful, with friendly stewards, easy baggage
check and boarding, and a smooth takeoff. After about 10 minutes in the air,
the plane explodes with no warning whatsoever. Windows NT Air Just like
Windows Air, but costs more, uses much bigger planes, and takes out all the
other aircraft within a 40-mile radius when it explodes.

Linux Air
---------

Disgruntled employees of all the other OS airlines decide to start their own
airline. They build the planes and ticket counters, and pave the runways
themselves. They charge a small fee to cover the cost of printing the ticket,
but you can also download and print the ticket yourself. When you board the
plane, you are given a seat, four bolts, a wrench, and a copy of the seat-
HOWTO.html. Once settled, the fully adjustable seat is very comfortable, the
plane leaves and arrives on time without a single problem, the in-flight meal
is wonderful. You try to tell customers of the other airlines about the great
trip, but all they can say is, "You had to do what with the seat?"
