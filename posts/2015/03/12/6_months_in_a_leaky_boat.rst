.. description: Retrospective on six months being treated under work cover.
.. type: text

It has been a little while since my last (rather melancholic) update so I
figured it's time to update the world on progress so far.  First of all,
progress is still happenning, albeit a little slower than before.  My shoulder
continues to heal and I am gaining a little more mobility in stages.  Seems
"something" goes right, things get better, then nothing for a week or two.
Apparently this is *normal*.  Go figure.

Pain is still a regular feature in my consciousness, and it has been getting a
little worse lately.  This in turn prompted a bit of an investigation with the
good old MRI.  A wonderful gizmo and marvel of modern technology.
Unfortunately also a noisy damn thing and having to lie still in a rather
uncomfortable position for quite some time meant it wasn't a particularly
pleasurable experience.  Still, the images were obtained, a radiologist
reviewed them and sure enough, there are reasons my shoulder hurts as much as
it does.  Capsulitis, some evidence of torn bits, adhesions and generally a
lot of oedema and inflammation.  Yay.

Thankfully I have a great medical team around me who are responding to the
news and I can look forward to some cortisone injections guided by CT.  This
doesn't excite me particularly, but if it settles the nastiness causing the
pain, then I welcome it!

So the world sounds peachy right?  Wrong.  In the background to all this is
Work Cover.  A horribly broken bureaucracy which incentivises the people
running the system to focus on punting people (patients) out as soon as
possible, by any means, regardless of their medical status.  Don't like what a
specialist said? No worries, in Work Cover, they can just ignore that.
Changed diagnosis/prognosis?  Go ahead, ignore that too.  Want to make up your
own "recovery schedules" in spite of all medical evidence and best practise to
the contrary?  Knock yourself out.  If the patient or their medical team call
Work Cover out on their bull shit, then they just send you off to see one of
their doctors who, despite all evidence to support continued treatment will
probably accuse you of "faking it" and throw you out anyway.

My medical team have been fighting to get Work Cover (actually, the insurer)
to see reason but alas, it fell on deaf ears.  Today, barely 6 months into a
rehabillitation regime that generally takes at *least* twice that long, I was
sent off to see one of their doctors for an (anything but independant)
independant review.  I don't know what the outcome will be, but this doctor
was rude, arrogant, obstinant, refused to look at *any* specialist reports and
spent most of his time criticising the treament I have been receiving.  This
despite the fact I'm getting better and my doctors and therapists are
regularly impressed with the progress I'm making.  But this guy is paid by the
insurance company, so of course he wont want to hear anything that doesn't
support their desire to kick me off their books.

Despite the fact I am working, and Work Cover seem to think that means I'm
fixed, I do so in a state of constant pain which is being managed with some
powerful pain killers.  I still cannot drive, fly or travel long distances, I
can't lift anything significant, I can't do many things that used to bring me
pleasure (scuba diving, cycling, playing my violins, etc, etc) but apparently,
according to Work Cover, this is all an act or maybe I'm "faking it" because
hey, I'm working right?!

To all those miscreants who abused and rorted the Work Cover system, which led
to it being in the sorry state it now is, **thanks for nothing**.  Those of us who
are genuinely injured through honest accidents in the workplace are now
treated like common criminals by the insurers and have to struggle to be
granted even the most basic level of care and rehabillitation.
