The old site has gone. Long live PHP and all that.  Basically I got tired of
worrying about the security of an abandoned PHP-based CMS running behind
this new shiny site. Consequently I grabbed all the stories I thought were
relevent (over 100) and ported them from HTML to `reStructuredText`_ and dropped
them in.  However, I still need to recreate the galleries and other content
so as time (and bandwidth) permits, I'll start uploading them.  In the meantime
any attempt to go to the old site will just redirect back here.

So long Geeklog/GLFusion, you were a fun ride, but it's time to move on. :)
