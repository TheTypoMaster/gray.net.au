.. type: text

So, it's officially 122 days since I shattered my shoulder.  122 days, 10
hours and 28 minutes.  Not that I'm counting...no siree.  I'm writing this
blog post for as much my own benefit as for informing friends and family of
what progress is happening, so I apologise in advance if this rambles a little
in places; I need to get some stuff out of my head.

.. TEASER_END

The good news is, my surgeon hasn't put scalpel to skin (yet) and is
**extremely** pleased with my progress to date.  I have a reasonably
functional amount of movement in my shoulder with strength returning
incrementally as I work through exercises with my physiotherapist.  Speaking
of physiotherapists, she is also really happy how healing has progressed and
reassures me, on nearly every visit (twice a week!), I am a lot better off
this early in my recovery than *most* people who have shattered their
shoulders.  My family doctor, who is managing my recovery, is also impressed
with progress so far; and he used to be an orthopaedic surgeon too.


Ok, I get it.  I'm doing "great" according to the experts, and I should be
punching the air and pointing at my reflection saying "You're the man!".  Reality
is I'm increasingly impatient and wanting this whole "recovery" piece to be a
closed chapter in my life, allowing me to move on.  The problem is, I have just
*enough* mobility and strength in my shoulder to forget how badly screwed up
it is.  Then I'll reach for something, pick up something (like a cup of
coffee) or move a little differently and I'm almost completely overcome with
shooting pain from my shoulder down my right arm.  If I'm really unlucky,
I'll need to sit down and catch my breath; it's *that* painful.  It's **that**
pain that is preventing me from confidently getting back to things I enjoy,
like SCUBA diving, cycling and hitting the gym, you know, simple stuff an
average person might do outside the office.

I went snorkelling with the family today and it was awesome! I loved being back
in the water and floating around, sharing my underwater world with my wife and
children.  It was great!  Then a group of SCUBA divers showed up.  They were
obviously students and making a bit of a mess of things if I'm honest.
Despite being in the ocean, they looked like a few more pool sessions were
needed!  The odd part for me was that where before I would feel excitement for
these "noobs" and know they are starting a wonderful adventure that can keep
them engaged and excited for life, instead I was angry.  The thought ran
through my head "If they can't even do it properly they shouldn't be there,
**I should be the one diving**".  Ouch.  I quickly gave myself a kick in the
metaphoric nads and strong rebuttal, but it commenced a thought pattern I need
to get out of my head.  I'm sitting here wondering if I *really* did (do)
enjoy diving as much as I think I did (do).  Now, there's something only a
seriously dessicated diver can ponder.

So here's the bit I'm tired of: I'm tired of not being able to do the things
that make life exciting.  I'm tired of not being able to push my limits in the
water and on land (sorry, physio doesn't count...they keep telling me to stop
over doing it!).  I need something to get my blood pumping! I need something
that stretches me mentally, physically and emotionally.  For me, SCUBA diving
scratches that itch, and right now I feel like I'm covered in itching powder
and wrapped in a straight jacket :(
