=========
Welcome!
=========
It's been a long time coming
-----------------------------

Anyone who has been to this site in the last year or so would've noticed it's a bit 
stale.  Ok, it's a *LOT* stale.  One of the problems I've had is the time it took to
make changes to the site was more than I had available and offline editing was a 
pain.  Instead of going with an all-singing, all-dancing website with all sorts of
features that no-one except myself really cared about, I've made it very simple.
We have articles, news, blogs, some photos....and that's about it.

Given the online world we all live in is largely centred around "cloud" services, 
such as Facebook, Flickr and the like, I've simply made this site fill a gap in my
own use case and scratch an itch.  That's all.  Hopefully this will allow me to
update more regularly.

If you would like to see the old site, it's been put out to pasture over `here 
<http://gray.net.au/old_site>`_.

In the meantime, here's a panorama from a recent trip to Honiara :)
