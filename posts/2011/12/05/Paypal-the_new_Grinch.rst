Have you heard the news? PayPal has decided that donating gifts and money to
needy children and families is wrong. So wrong that they’ll take their cut of
the donations, then require that the organizer refund all the money (that
PayPal took their cut of); then allow the organizer to sell the (already
purchased) gifts (and take a cut of the sales); then decide that because it’s
not a charity for cats, but for kids, all of the sales have to be refunded
(giving PayPal another transaction cut); and then, to add insult to injury,
freezing the personal account of the organizer.
