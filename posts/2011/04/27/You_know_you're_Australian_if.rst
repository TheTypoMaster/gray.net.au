**A swag of truisms to test your True Blue, Aussie status!**

.. TEASER_END

* You believe that stubbies can be either drunk or worn.
* You waddle when you walk due to the 53 expired petrol discount vouchers
  stuffed in your wallet or purse.
* You've made a bong out of your garden hose rather than use it for something
  illegal such as watering the garden.
* You think it's normal to have a leader called Julia.
* You believe it is appropriate to put a rubber in your son's pencil case when
  he first attends school.
* You're liable to burst out laughing whenever you hear of Americans "rooting"
  for something.
* You understand that the phrase 'a group of women wearing black thongs'
  refers to footwear and may be less alluring than it sounds.
* You pronounce Melbourne as 'Mel-bn'.
* You believe the 'l' in the word ' Australia' is optional.
* You know that some people pronounce Australia like "Strayla" and that's ok.
* You can translate: 'Dazza and Shazza played Acca Dacca on the way to Maccas.'
* You believe it makes perfect sense for a nation to decorate its highways with
  large fibreglass bananas, prawns and sheep.
* You call your best friend 'a total bastard' but someone you really, truly
  despise is just 'a bit of a bastard'.
* You think 'Woolloomooloo' is a perfectly reasonable name for a place.
* You're secretly proud of our killer wildlife.
* You believe it makes sense for a country to have a $1 coin that's twice as
  big as its $2 coin.
* You understand that 'Wagga Wagga' can be abbreviated to 'Wagga' but
  'Woy Woy' can't be called 'Woy'.
* You believe that cooked-down axle grease makes a good breakfast spread.
  You've also squeezed it through Vita Wheat biscuits to make little Vegemite
  worms.
* You believe all famous Kiwis are actually Australian, until they stuff up,
  at which point they become Kiwis again.
* Hamburger with Beetroot? Of course!
* You know that certain words must, by law, be shouted out during any
  rendition of the Angels' song 'Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again'.
* You believe that the confectionery known as the Wagon Wheel has become
  smaller with every passing year.
* You wear ugh boots outside the house.
* You believe that every important discovery in the world was made by an
  Australian but then sold off to the Yanks for a pittance.
* You believe that the more you shorten someone's name the more you like them.
* Whatever your linguistic skills, you find yourself able to order takeaway
  fluently in every Asian language.
* You understand that 'excuse me' can sound rude, while 'scuse me' is always
  polite.
* You know what it's like to swallow a fly.
* You know it's not summer until the steering wheel is too hot to handle and
  a seat belt buckle becomes a pretty good branding iron.
* Your biggest family argument over the summer concerned the rules for beach
  cricket.
* You shake your head in horror when companies try to market what they call
  'Anzac cookies'.
* You still think of Kylie as 'that girl off Neighbours'.
* You understand that all train timetables are works of fiction.
* When working in a bar, you understand male customers will feel the need to
  offer an excuse whenever they order low-alcohol beer.
* You know how to abbreviate every word, all of which usually end in -o: arvo,
  combo, garbo, kero, lezzo, metho, milko, muso, rego, servo, smoko, speedo,
  righto etc.
* You know that there is a universal place called "woop woop" located in the
  middle of nowhere...no matter where  you actually are.
* You know that none of us actually drink Fosters beer, because it tastes like
  crap. But we let the world think we do. Because we can.
* You have some time in your life slept with Aeroguard on in the summer. Maybe
  even as perfume.
* You've only ever used the words - tops, ripper, sick, mad, rad, and sweet -
  to mean good. And then you place 'bloody' in front of it when you REALLY
  mean it.
* You know that the barbeque is a political arena; the person holding the
  tongs is always the boss and usually a man... and the women make the salad.
* You say 'no worries' quite often, whether you realise it or not.
* You've drank your tea/coffee/milo through a Tim Tam.
* You own a Bond's chesty. In several different colours.
* You've ordered a steak the size of your head and only paid $5 at your local
  RSL.
* You know that roo meat tastes pretty good, but not as good as barra. Or a
  meat pie.
* And you will immediately forward this list to other Australians, here and
  overseas, realising that only they will understand.
