A man piloting a hot air balloon discovers he has wandered off course
and is hopelessly lost. He descends to a lower altitude and locates a
man down on the ground. He lowers the balloon further and shouts,
"Excuse me, can you tell me where I am?"

The man below says, "Yes, you're in a hot air balloon, about 30 feet
above this field."

"You must work in Information Technology," says the balloonist.

"Yes I do," replies the man. "And how did you know that?"

"Well," says the balloonist, "what you told me is technically correct,
but of no use to anyone."

The man below says, "You must work in management."

"I do," replies the balloonist, "how did you know?"

"Well," says the man, "you don't know where you are, or where you're
going, but you expect my immediate help. You're in the same position
you were before we met, but now it's my fault!"

This reminds of some employers I've worked for...who shall remain
nameless - you know who you are!
