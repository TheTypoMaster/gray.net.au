A few people have asked for me to provide a copy of my address I did
at church recently. In case you missed it, the minister (Ken Bond) is
doing a series on "Living by Faith" and drawing from the life of
Abraham as the base for the series. The first of these was on the 13th
of April this year and covered the call made upon Abraham to leave his
life as he knew it, move somewhere completely foreign, and unknown,
and do it all "on faith". We all know the story, but have any of us
actually lived it ? Ken thought that my experience of having to leave
the aviation industry and head off without a clue of where I or
Natalie were going has a striking number of parallels to Abraham's
experience.

So Ken asked me if I would like to have an informal "interview" on
stage for the first of these "living by Faith" sermons where I could
relay my experience. Of course I jumped at the opportunity! Ever since
I learned of my hearing problem and realised my dream of an aviation
career was over, I vowed that the very least I wanted from the whole
saga was for other people to see God in the middle of it. As it turns
out, I think I achieved that both in how I dealt with that loss, and
secondly how I relayed my experience in church a few weeks ago.
Certainly, the feed back I have received has been overwhelming and
people are genuinely surprised that I have come through this without
being bitter and twisted. My only response to those sort of comments
has been to point people to the source of my strength:

* Isaiah 40:31 (New International Version) but those who hope in the
LORD
will renew their strength.
They will soar on wings like eagles;
they will run and not grow weary,
they will walk and not be faint.*

*Apologies for all the "arrrr"'s in my monologue....it was the first
time I've relayed this story in public and I was very nervous...the
second service that morning was a LOT better, but I don't have that
recording :(*
