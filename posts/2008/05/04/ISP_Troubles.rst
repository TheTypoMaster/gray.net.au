Yesterday from about 2pm to 8pm Aust EST, my ISP had some serious routing
problems. This, unfortunately, isolated my network from vast tracts of the
Internet for the duration. Some people could get to my site, whereas others
could not. As far as I know, locally TPG, Internode and iiNet subscribers
would have been unable to reach my site, but Optus and Bigpond subscribers
could NOT. International ISP's seemed to be very hit-and-miss. I have no idea
what went pop for my ISP, but it was intensely frustrating! Apologies to
anyone who had mail problems with my site or couldn't access the web site.
