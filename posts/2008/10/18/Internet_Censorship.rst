Ordinarily I don't make a big song and dance about stupid decisions
made by politicians - I've come to understand the average politician
has the intelligence of a lobotomised amoeba...but I digress.

Many have heard me lament the short-sighted, wasteful policies
implemented by various Ministers for Communication ( *particularly
Senator Alston*) under the previous regime in Canberra. I hate to say
it, but the incumbent administration has truly exceeded even my worst
imaginings. Everyone on this list knows the Internet, and has come to
rely on it one fashion or another so I think it prudent to at least
make you aware of the level of stupidity the current government has
stooped to.

Read it, and make your own choices. Take it from me, being someone who
has worked at the ISP level for a company that hosted all of Telstra's
wholesale ISPs and hosted all of TransACT, AAPT and Telstra-Clear NZ,
this is a bad policy for * all * Australians. Even if you ignore the
policy, or moral standpoints, the technology to implement this simply
does not exist . The outcome will be millions of tax payer dollars
wasted on grand ideas, with questionable motivations, to attempt
something that can only be achieved under the draconian levels of
government oversight and intervention seen in places like China, Burma
and North Korea.

I always thought we lived in a democracy populated by intelligent
people able to make their own decisions. I DO NOT need the Australian
Labour Party, or any other political party, to dictate what is and
isn't appropriate for my children or myself.

Please read the link above and if you are motivated to do so, please
contact the minister with either your support or objection to his
proposal. I have added a block that is persistent across my site to
drive as much traffic as I can to the fight against this policy. If
you are in a position to do likewise, please consider it.
