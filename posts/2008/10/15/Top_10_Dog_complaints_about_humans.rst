#. Blaming your farts on me...... not funny.. not funny at all!
#. Yelling at me for barking........ I'M A DOG YOU IDIOT!
#. Taking me for a walk, then not letting me check stuff out. Exactly
   whose walk is this anyway?
#. Any trick that involves balancing food on my nose... stop it!
#. Any haircut that involves bows or ribbons. Now you know why we chew
   your stuff up when you're not home.
#. The sleight of hand, fake fetch throw. You fooled a dog!
   WhooooHoooooooo what a proud moment for the top of the food chain.
#. Taking me to the vet for "the big snip", then acting surprised when
   I freak out every time we go back!
#. Getting upset when I sniff the crotches of your guests. Sorry, but
   I haven't quite mastered that handshake thing yet.
#. Dog sweaters..... Hello?? Haven't you noticed the fur?
#. How you act disgusted when I lick myself. Look, we both know the
   truth, you're just jealous.
