Here's another gem from the late 90's that did the rounds. Haven't
seen it since, and I thought I'd lost this one too - turned out to be
on the same drive I thought was empty that turned up the flying
instructions for the F18!! Anyway, now that I have children of my own,
this letter below (click "read more") has taken on a fresh
perspective.

*Fill in where necessary*

Dear :

Thank you for leaving [_] tooth/teeth under your pillow last night.

While we make every attempt to leave a monetary reward in the case of
lost or stolen children's teeth, we were unable to process your
request for the following reason(s) indicated below:

(_) the tooth could not be found

(_) it was not a human tooth

(_) we do not think that pieces of chicken bone are very funny

(_) we were unable to approach the tooth due to excessive odor

(_) the tooth has previously been redeemed for cash

(_) the tooth did not originally belong to you

(_) you were overheard to state that you do not believe in the tooth fairy

(_) you were age 12 or older at the time your request was received

(_) the tooth is still in your mouth

(_) the tooth was guarded by a vicious fairy-eating dog at the time of our visit

(_) the snacks provided for the tooth fairy were not satisfactory, or were missing

(_) we discovered evidence of unsafe tooth extraction as follows:

#. [__] string
#. [__] pliers
#. [__] gunpowder
#. [__] hammer marks
#. [__] chisel
#. [__] part of skull attached to tooth
#. [__] no dental care
#. [__] other: *(specify)*..........................................


Instead of the usual cash redemption, we have provided the following
certificate which you may attempt to exchange at a retail store near
you. Thank you for your request, and we look forward to serving you in
the future.

Sincerely,

*The Tooth Fairy*
