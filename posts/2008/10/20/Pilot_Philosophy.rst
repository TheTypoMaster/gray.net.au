Know any pilots? Did you happen to marry one? (Poor you!!). Well these might
help decipher the complex nature of Pilot Philospghy!

* The difference between a duck and a co-pilot?
  *The duck can fly.*
* A check ride ought to be like a skirt.
  *Short enough to be interesting, but long enough to cover everything.*
* Speed is life. Altitude is life insurance.
* It only takes two things to fly:
  *Airspeed, and money.*
* The three most dangerous things in aviation:
  #. *A Doctor or Dentist in a Cessna.*
  #. *Two captains in a DC-9.*
* Aircraft Identification:
  * *If it's ugly, it's British.*
  * *If it's weird, it's French.*
  * *If it's ugly and weird, it's Russian.*
* Without ammunition, the RAAF would be just another very expensive flying club.
* The similarity between air traffic controllers and pilots?
  *If a pilot screws up, the pilot dies.*
   *If ATC screws up, the pilot dies.*
* The difference between flight attendants and jet engines:
  *The engines usually quit whining when they get to the gate.*
* New CASA motto:
  *'We're not happy, till you're not happy.'*
* If something hasn't broken on your helicopter --it's about to.
* I give that landing a 9....on the Richter scale.
* Basic Flying Rules:
  * Try to stay in the middle of the air.
  * Do not go near the edges of it.
  * The edges of the air can be recognized by the appearance of ground,
    buildings, sea, trees and interstellar space. It is much more difficult
    to fly in the edges.
* Unknown landing signal officer (LSO) to carrier pilot after his 6th
  unsuccessful landing attempt:
  *"You've got to land here son. This is where the food is."*
* The three best things in life are:
  *A good landing, a good orgasm, and a good bowel movement. A night carrier
  landing is one of the few opportunities to experience all three at the same time.*
