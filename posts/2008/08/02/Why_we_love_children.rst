A frined of mine sent this to me via e-mail and I just had to add it
to my funny anecdotes :)

.. TEASER_END

#. **NUDITY** I was driving with my three young children one warm summer
   evening when a woman in the convertible ahead of us stood up and
   waved. She was stark naked! As I was reeling from the shock, I heard
   my 5-year-old shout from the back seat, 'Mom, that lady isn't wearing
   a seat belt!'
#. **OPINIONS** On the first day of school, a first-grader handed his
   teacher a note from his mother. The note read, 'The opinions expressed
   by this child are not necessarily those of his parents.'
#. **KETCHUP** A woman was trying hard to get the ketchup out of the jar.
   During her struggle the phone rang so she asked her 4-year-old
   daughter to answer the phone. 'Mommy can't come to the phone to talk
   to you right now. She's hitting the bottle.'
#. **MORE NUDITY** A little boy got lost at the YMCA and found himself in
   the women's locker room. When he was spotted, the room burst into
   shrieks, with nude women grabbing towels and running for cover. The
   little boy watched in amazement and then asked, 'What's the matter,
   haven't you ever seen a little boy before?'
#. **POLICE # 1** While taking a routine vandalism report at an elementary
   school, I was interrupted by a little girl about 6 years old. Looking
   up and down at my uniform, she asked, 'Are you a cop?' 'Yes' I
   answered and continued writing the report. 'My mother said if I ever
   needed help I should ask the police. Is that right?' 'Yes, that's
   right,' I told her. 'Well, then,' she said as she extended her foot
   toward me, 'would you please tie my shoe?'
#. **POLICE #2** It was the end of the day when I parked my police van in
   front of the station. As I gathered my equipment, my K-9 partner,
   Jake, was barking, and I saw a little boy staring in at me. 'Is that a
   dog you got back there?' he asked. 'It sure is,' I replied. Puzzled,
   the boy looked at me and then towards the back of the van. Finally he
   said, 'What'd he do?'
#. **ELDERLY** While working for an organization that delivers lunches to
   elderly shut-ins, I used to take my 4-year-old daughter on my
   afternoon rounds. She was unfailingly intrigued by the various
   appliances of old age, particularly the canes, walkers and
   wheelchairs. One day I found her staring at a pair of false teeth
   soaking in a glass. As I braced myself for the inevitable barrage of
   questions, she merely turned and whispered, 'The tooth fairy will
   never believe this!'
#. **DRESS-UP** A little girl was watching her parents dress for a party.
   When she saw her dad donning his tuxedo, she warned, 'Daddy, you
   shouldn't wear that suit.' 'And why not, darling?' 'You know that it
   always gives you a headache the next morning.'
#. **DEATH** While walking along the sidewalk in front of his church, our
   minister heard the intoning of a prayer that nearly made his collar
   wilt. Apparently, his 5-year-old son and his playmates had found a
   dead robin. Feeling that proper burial should be performed, they had
   secured a small box and cotton batting, then dug a hole an d made
   ready for the disposal of the deceased. The minister's son was chosen
   to say the appropriate prayers and with sonorous dignity intoned his
   version of what he thought his father always said: 'Glory be unto the
   Faaather, and unto the Sonnn, and into the hole he goooes.' (I want
   this line used at my funeral!)
#. **SCHOOL** A little girl had just finished her first week of school.
   'I'm just wasting my time,' she said to her mother. 'I can't read, I
   can't write, and they won't let me talk!'
#. **BIBLE** A little boy opened the big family Bible. He was fascinated
   as he fingered through the old pages. Suddenly, something fell out of
   the Bible. He picked up the object and looked at it. What he saw was
   an old leaf that had been pressed in between the pages. 'Mama, look
   what I found,' the boy called out. 'What have you got there, dear?'
   With astonishment in the young boy's voice, he answered, 'I think it's
   Adam's underwear!'
